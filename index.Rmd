Welcome to the Introduction of coding and version control:R, unix, git, QGIS course for MAMOD. In this part of the workshop we aim to teach basic concepts, skills and tools for working with data so that you can get more done in less time, and with less pain. The lessons here focus mainly on the use of R, but we will have an additional week of introduction to unix/shell, version control using git and deadling with spatial data using QGIS.

## Preparations

This workshops is expected to be hands-on, and to follow this lessons participants must have Git, R, RStudio and QGIS installed on their computers. You also need to be able to install a number of R packages, create directories and download files.

To avoid troubleshooting during the lesson, participants should follow the instructions from [Carpentries](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/) to download and install everything beforehand. If you are using your own computers this should be no problem,  but if the computer is managed by your organization's IT department you might need help from an IT administrator. 

Follow the instructions for:
- Git
- Shell
- R and Rstudio

Addititionally we include the instructions for QGIS:


###  Installing QGIS

Follow the [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) download for the appropriate operating system to download on your computer.

1. Scroll down and click on "QGIS Standalone Installer Version 3.26" to download the installer package: this is recommended for new users 
2. Save the window installer package in you desired location, usually on the C drive ("C:/Program Files/QGIS 3.26.2/") 
3. Double click the installer and follow the prompts to install QGIS


<br>


### Update R and RStudio

If you already have R and RStudio installed, first check if your R version is
up to date:

* When you open RStudio your R version will be printed in the console on 
  the bottom left. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()` into the console.
  If your R version is 4.0.0 or later, you don't need to update R for this 
  lesson. If your version of R is older than that, download and install the 
  latest version of R from the R project website
  [for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/), 
  [for MacOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/),
  or [for Linux](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/)
* It is not necessary to remove old versions of R from your system, 
  but if you wish to do so you can check
  [How do I uninstall R?](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f) 
* Note: The changes introduced by new R versions are usually backwards-compatible. 
  That is, your old code should still work after updating your R version.
  However, if breaking changes happen, it is useful to know that you can have 
  multiple versions of R installed in parallel and that you can switch between 
  them in RStudio by going to `Tools > Global Options > General > Basic`.
* After installing a new version of R, you will have to reinstall all your packages
  with the new version. For Windows, there is a package called `installr` that can 
  help you with upgrading your R version and migrate your package library.
  
To update RStudio to the latest version, open RStudio and click on 
`Help > Check for Updates`. If a new version is available follow the 
instruction on screen. By default, RStudio will also automatically notify you 
of new versions every once in a while.

### Install required R packages

During the course we will need a number of R packages. Packages contain useful 
R code written by other people. We will use the packages 
`tidyverse`, `sf` and `terra` mainly for this workshop.

To try to install these packages, open RStudio. If this is your first time opening it you may be prompted to set a CRAN mirror - select any country or even the R global cran. This step is important because [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/#:~:text=CRAN%20is%20a%20network%20of,you%20to%20minimize%20network%20load.) aka *Comprehensive R Archive Network* is where R stores many useful packages that we may use. If you forgot to set this up or wish to change yours you can go to `Tools` -> `Global Options` -> `Packages`, you will have a screen that looks like this:

```{r settingCRAN, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cran.png")
```

You can change CRAN by clicking the `change...` button. Additionally, make sure that the section circled in red in the image above is not selected

Next, copy and paste the following command into the console window (look for a blinking cursor on the bottom left),
then press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> (Windows and Linux) or <kbd>Return</kbd> (MacOS) 
to execute the command.

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
list.of.packages <- c("tidyverse", "sf", "terra", "rgdal", "sp", "raster", "scico", "RColorBrewer", "viridis", "viridisLite", "ggplot2", "tidyr", "dplyr", "readxl")
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)
```

Alternatively, you can install the packages using RStudio's graphical user 
interface by going to `Tools > Install Packages` and typing the names of the 
packages separated by a comma.

R tries to download and install the packages on your machine. Tidyverse is a group of packages so it can take some time to load. 
When the installation has finished, you can try to load the
packages by pasting the following code into the console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(terra)
library(rgdal)
```

If you do not see an error like `there is no package called ‘...’` you are good 
to go! 

Also note that when you load a package like tidyverse in for the first time you may see such test in your console:

```{r tidyverseload, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/load_tidyverse.png")
```

This text is simply telling you what packages have loaded under tidyverse and also telling you that there were function in base R that had the same names as those in tidyverse and they have been 'over-written' by the tidyverse ones. Additionally some of you may see some warning signs:

```{r warnings, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/warnings.png")
```

`Warnings` are normally ok to ignore. Usually when you see a warning in R, it will still process the command you've entered, and just wants to draw your attention that later on you may have issues because of the text in the warning. Please ignore any warnings you may see.

### Updating R packages

Generally, it is recommended to keep your R version and all packages
up to date, because new versions bring improvements and important bugfixes.
To update the packages that you have installed, click `Update` in the
`Packages` tab in the bottom right panel of RStudio, or go to
`Tools > Check for Package Updates...`. 

Sometimes, package updates introduce changes that break your old code, 
which can be very frustrating. To avoid this problem, you can use a package 
called `renv`. It locks the package versions you have used for a given project 
and makes it straightforward to reinstall those exact package version in a 
new environment, for example after updating your R version or on another 
computer. However, the details are outside of the scope of this lesson.
