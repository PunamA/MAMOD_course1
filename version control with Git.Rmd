# Automated Version Control

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Understand the benefits of an automated version control system.
- Understand the basics of how automated version control systems work.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- What is version control and why should I use it?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We'll start by exploring how version control can be used
to keep track of what one person did and when.
Even if you aren't collaborating with other people,
automated version control is much better than this situation:

!["notFinal.doc" by Jorge Cham, <https://www.phdcomics.com>](fig/phd101212s.png){alt='Comic: a PhD student sends "FINAL.doc" to their supervisor, but after several increasingly intense and frustrating rounds of comments and revisions they end up with a file named "FINAL_rev.22.comments49.corrections.10.#@$%WHYDIDCOMETOGRADSCHOOL????.doc"'}

We've all been in this situation before: it seems unnecessary to have
multiple nearly-identical versions of the same document. Some word
processors let us deal with this a little better, such as Microsoft
Word's
[Track Changes](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Track-changes-in-Word-197ba630-0f5f-4a8e-9a77-3712475e806a),
Google Docs' [version history](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843?hl=en), or
LibreOffice's [Recording and Displaying Changes](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Recording_and_Displaying_Changes).

Version control systems start with a base version of the document and
then record changes you make each step of the way. You can
think of it as a recording of your progress: you can rewind to start at the base
document and play back each change you made, eventually arriving at your
more recent version.

![](fig/play-changes.svg){alt='Changes Are Saved Sequentially'}

Once you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you
can then think about "playing back" different sets of changes on the base document, ultimately
resulting in different versions of that document. For example, two users can make independent
sets of changes on the same document.

![](fig/versions.svg){alt='Different Versions Can be Saved'}

Unless multiple users make changes to the same section of the document - a conflict - you can
incorporate two sets of changes into the same base document.

![](fig/merge.svg){alt='Multiple Versions Can be Merged'}

A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us,
effectively creating different versions of our files. It allows us to decide
which changes will be made to the next version (each record of these changes is
called a [commit](../learners/reference.md#commit)), and keeps useful metadata
about them. The complete history of commits for a particular project and their
metadata make up a [repository](../learners/reference.md#repository).
Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers, facilitating
collaboration among different people.

## The Long History of Version Control Systems

Automated version control systems are nothing new.
Tools like [RCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System), [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System), or [Subversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion) have been around since the early 1980s and are used by
many large companies.
However, many of these are now considered legacy systems (i.e., outdated) due to various
limitations in their capabilities.
More modern systems, such as Git and [Mercurial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/hg-novice/),
are *distributed*, meaning that they do not need a centralized server to host the repository.
These modern systems also include powerful merging tools that make it possible for
multiple authors to work on
the same files concurrently.

## Paper Writing

- Imagine you drafted an excellent paragraph for a paper you are writing, but later ruin
  it. How would you retrieve the *excellent* version of your conclusion? Is it even possible?

- Imagine you have 5 co-authors. How would you manage the changes and comments
  they make to your paper?  If you use LibreOffice Writer or Microsoft Word, what happens if
  you accept changes made using the `Track Changes` option? Do you have a
  history of those changes?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

- Recovering the excellent version is only possible if you created a copy
  of the old version of the paper. The danger of losing good versions
  often leads to the problematic workflow illustrated in the PhD Comics
  cartoon at the top of this page.

- Collaborative writing with traditional word processors is cumbersome.
  Either every collaborator has to work on a document sequentially
  (slowing down the process of writing), or you have to send out a
  version to all collaborators and manually merge their comments into
  your document. The 'track changes' or 'record changes' option can
  highlight changes for you and simplifies merging, but as soon as you
  accept changes you will lose their history. You will then no longer
  know who suggested that change, why it was suggested, or when it was
  merged into the rest of the document. Even online word processors like
  Google Docs or Microsoft Office Online do not fully resolve these
  problems.

- Version control is like an unlimited 'undo'.
- Version control also allows many people to work in parallel.

# Setting Up Git

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Configure `git` the first time it is used on a computer.
- Understand the meaning of the `--global` configuration flag.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How do I get set up to use Git?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When we use Git on a new computer for the first time,
we need to configure a few things. Below are a few examples
of configurations we will set as we get started with Git:

- our name and email address,
- what our preferred text editor is,
- and that we want to use these settings globally (i.e. for every project).

On a command line, Git commands are written as `git verb options`,
where `verb` is what we actually want to do and `options` is additional optional information which may be needed for the `verb`. So here is how
Dracula sets up his new laptop:

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Vlad Dracula"
$ git config --global user.email "vlad@tran.sylvan.ia"
```

Please use your own name and email address instead of Dracula's. This user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity,
which means that any changes pushed to
[GitHub](https://github.com/),
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/),
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or
another Git host server
after this lesson will include this information.

For this lesson, we will be interacting with [GitHub](https://github.com/) and so the email address used should be the same as the one used when setting up your GitHub account. If you are concerned about privacy, please review [GitHub's instructions for keeping your email address private][git-privacy].

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Keeping your email private

If you elect to use a private email address with GitHub, then use that same email address for the `user.email` value, e.g. `username@users.noreply.github.com` replacing `username` with your GitHub one.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Line Endings

As with other keys, when you hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>âµ</kbd> or on Macs, <kbd>Return</kbd> on your keyboard,
your computer encodes this input as a character.
Different operating systems use different character(s) to represent the end of a line.
(You may also hear these referred to as newlines or line breaks.)
Because Git uses these characters to compare files,
it may cause unexpected issues when editing a file on different machines.
Though it is beyond the scope of this lesson, you can read more about this issue
[in the Pro Git book](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration#_core_autocrlf).

You can change the way Git recognizes and encodes line endings
using the `core.autocrlf` command to `git config`.
The following settings are recommended:

On macOS and Linux:

```bash
$ git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

And on Windows:

```bash
$ git config --global core.autocrlf true
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Dracula also has to set his favorite text editor, following this table:

| Editor                                | Configuration command | 
| :-----------                          | :------------------------------ |

| nano                                  | `$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"`                      | 
| BBEdit (Mac, with command line tools) | `$ git config --global core.editor "bbedit -w"`                      | 
| Sublime Text (Mac)                    | `$ git config --global core.editor "/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl -n -w"`                      | 
| Sublime Text (Win, 32-bit install)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"`                      | 
| Sublime Text (Win, 64-bit install)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"`                      | 
| Notepad (Win)                         | `$ git config --global core.editor "c:/Windows/System32/notepad.exe"`                      | 
| Notepad++ (Win, 32-bit install)       | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`                      |

| Kate (Linux)                          | `$ git config --global core.editor "kate"`                      | 
| Gedit (Linux)                         | `$ git config --global core.editor "gedit --wait --new-window"`                      | 
| Scratch (Linux)                       | `$ git config --global core.editor "scratch-text-editor"`                      | 
| Emacs                                 | `$ git config --global core.editor "emacs"`                      | 
| Vim                                   | `$ git config --global core.editor "vim"`                      | 
| VS Code                               | `$ git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`                      | 

It is possible to reconfigure the text editor for Git whenever you want to change it.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Exiting Vim

Note that Vim is the default editor for many programs. If you haven't used Vim before and wish to exit a session without saving
your changes, press <kbd>Esc</kbd> then type `:q!` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>âµ</kbd> or on Macs, <kbd>Return</kbd>.
If you want to save your changes and quit, press <kbd>Esc</kbd> then type `:wq` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>âµ</kbd> or on Macs, <kbd>Return</kbd>.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Git (2.28+) allows configuration of the name of the branch created when you
initialize any new repository.  Dracula decides to use that feature to set it to `main` so
it matches the cloud service he will eventually use.

```bash
$ git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Default Git branch naming

Source file changes are associated with a "branch."
For new learners in this lesson, it's enough to know that branches exist, and this lesson uses one branch.  
By default, Git will create a branch called `master`
when you create a new repository with `git init` (as explained in the next Episode). This term evokes
the racist practice of human slavery and the
[software development community](https://github.com/github/renaming)  has moved to adopt
more inclusive language.

In 2020, most Git code hosting services transitioned to using `main` as the default
branch. As an example, any new repository that is opened in GitHub and GitLab default
to `main`.  However, Git has not yet made the same change.  As a result, local repositories
must be manually configured have the same main branch name as most cloud services.

For versions of Git prior to 2.28, the change can be made on an individual repository level.  The
command for this is in the next episode.  Note that if this value is unset in your local Git
configuration, the `init.defaultBranch` value defaults to `master`.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The five commands we just ran above only need to be run once: the flag `--global` tells Git
to use the settings for every project, in your user account, on this computer.

Let's review those settings and test our `core.editor` right away:

```bash
$ git config --global --edit
```

Let's close the file without making any additional changes.  Remember, since typos in the config file will cause
issues, it's safer to view the configuration with:

```bash
$ git config --list
```

And if necessary, change your configuration using the
same commands to choose another editor or update your email address.
This can be done as many times as you want.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Proxy

In some networks you need to use a
[proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server). If this is the case, you
may also need to tell Git about the proxy:

```bash
$ git config --global http.proxy proxy-url
$ git config --global https.proxy proxy-url
```

To disable the proxy, use

```bash
$ git config --global --unset http.proxy
$ git config --global --unset https.proxy
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Git Help and Manual

Always remember that if you forget the subcommands or options of a `git` command, you can access the
relevant list of options typing `git <command> -h` or access the corresponding Git manual by typing
`git <command> --help`, e.g.:

```bash
$ git config -h
$ git config --help
```

While viewing the manual, remember the `:` is a prompt waiting for commands and you can press <kbd>Q</kbd> to exit the manual.

More generally, you can get the list of available `git` commands and further resources of the Git manual typing:

```bash
$ git help
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

[git-privacy]: https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/

- Use `git config` with the `--global` option to configure a user name, email address, editor, and other preferences once per machine.

First, let's create a new directory in the `Desktop` folder for our work and then change the current working directory to the newly created one:

```bash
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir planets
$ cd planets
```

Then we tell Git to make `planets` a [repository](../learners/reference.md#repository)
\-- a place where Git can store versions of our files:

```bash
$ git init
```

It is important to note that `git init` will create a repository that
can include subdirectories and their files---there is no need to create
separate repositories nested within the `planets` repository, whether
subdirectories are present from the beginning or added later. Also, note
that the creation of the `planets` directory and its initialization as a
repository are completely separate processes.

If we use `ls` to show the directory's contents,
it appears that nothing has changed:

```bash
$ ls
```

But if we add the `-a` flag to show everything,
we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within `planets` called `.git`:

```bash
$ ls -a
```

```output
.	..	.git
```

Git uses this special subdirectory to store all the information about the project,
including the tracked files and sub-directories located within the project's directory.
If we ever delete the `.git` subdirectory,
we will lose the project's history.

Next, we will change the default branch to be called `main`.
This might be the default branch depending on your settings and version
of git.
See the [setup episode](02-setup.md#default-git-branch-naming) for more information on this change.

```bash
$ git checkout -b main
```

```output
Switched to a new branch 'main'
```

We can check that everything is set up correctly
by asking Git to tell us the status of our project:

```bash
$ git status
```

```output
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

If you are using a different version of `git`, the exact
wording of the output might be slightly different.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Places to Create Git Repositories

Along with tracking information about planets (the project we have already created),
Dracula would also like to track information about moons.
Despite Wolfman's concerns, Dracula creates a `moons` project inside his `planets`
project with the following sequence of commands:

```bash
$ cd ~/Desktop   # return to Desktop directory
$ cd planets     # go into planets directory, which is already a Git repository
$ ls -a          # ensure the .git subdirectory is still present in the planets directory
$ mkdir moons    # make a subdirectory planets/moons
$ cd moons       # go into moons subdirectory
$ git init       # make the moons subdirectory a Git repository
$ ls -a          # ensure the .git subdirectory is present indicating we have created a new Git repository
```

Is the `git init` command, run inside the `moons` subdirectory, required for
tracking files stored in the `moons` subdirectory?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

No. Dracula does not need to make the `moons` subdirectory a Git repository
because the `planets` repository can track any files, sub-directories, and
subdirectory files under the `planets` directory.  Thus, in order to track
all information about moons, Dracula only needed to add the `moons` subdirectory
to the `planets` directory.

Additionally, Git repositories can interfere with each other if they are "nested":
the outer repository will try to version-control
the inner repository. Therefore, it's best to create each new Git
repository in a separate directory. To be sure that there is no conflicting
repository in the directory, check the output of `git status`. If it looks
like the following, you are good to go to create a new repository as shown
above:

```bash
$ git status
```

```output
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Correcting `git init` Mistakes

Wolfman explains to Dracula how a nested repository is redundant and may cause confusion
down the road. Dracula would like to remove the nested repository. How can Dracula undo
his last `git init` in the `moons` subdirectory?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution -- USE WITH CAUTION!

### Background

Removing files from a Git repository needs to be done with caution. But we have not learned
yet how to tell Git to track a particular file; we will learn this in the next episode. Files
that are not tracked by Git can easily be removed like any other "ordinary" files with

```bash
$ rm filename
```

Similarly a directory can be removed using `rm -r dirname` or `rm -rf dirname`.
If the files or folder being removed in this fashion are tracked by Git, then their removal
becomes another change that we will need to track, as we will see in the next episode.

### Solution

Git keeps all of its files in the `.git` directory.
To recover from this little mistake, Dracula can just remove the `.git`
folder in the moons subdirectory by running the following command from inside the `planets` directory:

```bash
$ rm -rf moons/.git
```

But be careful! Running this command in the wrong directory will remove
the entire Git history of a project you might want to keep.
Therefore, always check your current directory using the command `pwd`.



:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- `git init` initializes a repository.
- Git stores all of its repository data in the `.git` directory.

# Tracking Changes

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Go through the modify-add-commit cycle for one or more files.
- Explain where information is stored at each stage of that cycle.
- Distinguish between descriptive and non-descriptive commit messages.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How do I record changes in Git?
- How do I check the status of my version control repository?
- How do I record notes about what changes I made and why?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

First let's make sure we're still in the right directory.
You should be in the `planets` directory.

```bash
$ cd ~/Desktop/planets
```

Let's create a file called `mars.txt` that contains some notes
about the Red Planet's suitability as a base.
We'll use `nano` to edit the file;
you can use whatever editor you like.
In particular, this does not have to be the `core.editor` you set globally earlier. But remember, the bash command to create or edit a new file will depend on the editor you choose (it might not be `nano`). For a refresher on text editors, check out ["Which Editor?"](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create.html#which-editor) in [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) lesson.

```bash
$ nano mars.txt
```

Type the text below into the `mars.txt` file:

```output
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
```

Let's first verify that the file was properly created by running the list command (`ls`):

```bash
$ ls
```

```output
mars.txt
```

`mars.txt` contains a single line, which we can see by running:

```bash
$ cat mars.txt
```

```output
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
```

If we check the status of our project again,
Git tells us that it's noticed the new file:

```bash
$ git status
```

```output
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	mars.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

The "untracked files" message means that there's a file in the directory
that Git isn't keeping track of.
We can tell Git to track a file using `git add`:

```bash
$ git add mars.txt
```

and then check that the right thing happened:

```bash
$ git status
```

```output
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   mars.txt

```

Git now knows that it's supposed to keep track of `mars.txt`,
but it hasn't recorded these changes as a commit yet.
To get it to do that,
we need to run one more command:

```bash
$ git commit -m "Start notes on Mars as a base"
```

```output
[main (root-commit) f22b25e] Start notes on Mars as a base
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 mars.txt
```

When we run `git commit`,
Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add`
and stores a copy permanently inside the special `.git` directory.
This permanent copy is called a [commit](../learners/reference.md#commit)
(or [revision](../learners/reference.md#revision)) and its short identifier is `f22b25e`. Your commit may have another identifier.

We use the `-m` flag (for "message")
to record a short, descriptive, and specific comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why.
If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option,
Git will launch `nano` (or whatever other editor we configured as `core.editor`)
so that we can write a longer message.

[Good commit messages][commit-messages] start with a brief (\<50 characters) statement about the
changes made in the commit. Generally, the message should complete the sentence "If applied, this commit will" <commit message here>.
If you want to go into more detail, add a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes. Use this additional space to explain why you made changes and/or what their impact will be.

If we run `git status` now:

```bash
$ git status
```

```output
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

it tells us everything is up to date.
If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can ask Git to show us the project's history using `git log`:

```bash
$ git log
```

```output
commit f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b
Author: Vlad Dracula <vlad@tran.sylvan.ia>
Date:   Thu Aug 22 09:51:46 2013 -0400

    Start notes on Mars as a base
```

`git log` lists all commits  made to a repository in reverse chronological order.
The listing for each commit includes
the commit's full identifier
(which starts with the same characters as
the short identifier printed by the `git commit` command earlier),
the commit's author,
when it was created,
and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Where Are My Changes?

If we run `ls` at this point, we will still see just one file called `mars.txt`.
That's because Git saves information about files' history
in the special `.git` directory mentioned earlier
so that our filesystem doesn't become cluttered
(and so that we can't accidentally edit or delete an old version).


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Now suppose Dracula adds more information to the file.
(Again, we'll edit with `nano` and then `cat` the file to show its contents;
you may use a different editor, and don't need to `cat`.)

```bash
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
```

```output
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
```

When we run `git status` now,
it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:

```bash
$ git status
```

```output
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

The last line is the key phrase:
"no changes added to commit".
We have changed this file,
but we haven't told Git we will want to save those changes
(which we do with `git add`)
nor have we saved them (which we do with `git commit`).
So let's do that now. It is good practice to always review
our changes before saving them. We do this using `git diff`.
This shows us the differences between the current state
of the file and the most recently saved version:

```bash
$ git diff
```

```output
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..315bf3a 100644
--- a/mars.txt
+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
+The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
```

The output is cryptic because
it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and `patch`
telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other.
If we break it down into pieces:

1. The first line tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix `diff` command
  comparing the old and new versions of the file.
2. The second line tells exactly which versions of the file
  Git is comparing;
  `df0654a` and `315bf3a` are unique computer-generated labels for those versions.
3. The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed.
4. The remaining lines are the most interesting, they show us the actual differences
  and the lines on which they occur.
  In particular,
  the `+` marker in the first column shows where we added a line.

After reviewing our change, it's time to commit it:

```bash
$ git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman"
```

```output
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Whoops:
Git won't commit because we didn't use `git add` first.
Let's fix that:

```bash
$ git add mars.txt
$ git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman"
```

```output
[main 34961b1] Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit
before actually committing anything. This allows us to commit our
changes in stages and capture changes in logical portions rather than
only large batches.
For example,
suppose we're adding a few citations to relevant research to our thesis.
We might want to commit those additions,
and the corresponding bibliography entries,
but *not* commit some of our work drafting the conclusion
(which we haven't finished yet).

To allow for this,
Git has a special *staging area*
where it keeps track of things that have been added to
the current [changeset](../learners/reference.md#changeset)
but not yet committed.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Staging Area

If you think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the life of a project,
`git add` specifies *what* will go in a snapshot
(putting things in the staging area),
and `git commit` then *actually takes* the snapshot, and
makes a permanent record of it (as a commit).
If you don't have anything staged when you type `git commit`,
Git will prompt you to use `git commit -a` or `git commit --all`,
which is kind of like gathering *everyone* to take a group photo!
However, it's almost always better to
explicitly add things to the staging area, because you might
commit changes you forgot you made. (Going back to the group photo simile,
you might get an extra with incomplete makeup walking on
the stage for the picture because you used `-a`!)
Try to stage things manually,
or you might find yourself searching for "git undo commit" more
than you would like!


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

![](fig/git-staging-area.svg){alt='The Git Staging Area'}

Let's watch as our changes to a file move from our editor
to the staging area
and into long-term storage.
First,
we'll add another line to the file:

```bash
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
```

```output
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color

So far, so good:
we've added one line to the end of the file
(shown with a `+` in the first column).
Now let's put that change in the staging area
and see what `git diff` reports:

```bash
$ git add mars.txt
$ git diff
```

There is no output:
as far as Git can tell,
there's no difference between what it's been asked to save permanently
and what's currently in the directory.
However,
if we do this:

```bash
$ git diff --staged
```

```output

it shows us the difference between

Let's save our changes:

```bash
$ git commit -m "Discuss concerns about Mars' climate for Mummy"
```

## Word-based diffing

Sometimes, e.g. in the case of the text documents a line-wise
diff is too coarse. That is where the `--color-words` option of
`git diff` comes in very useful as it highlights the changed
words using colors.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Paging the Log

When the output of `git log` is too long to fit in your screen,
`git` uses a program to split it into pages of the size of your screen.
When this "pager" is called, you will notice that the last line in your
screen is a `:`, instead of your usual prompt.

- To get out of the pager, press <kbd>Q</kbd>.
- To move to the next page, press <kbd>Spacebar</kbd>.
- To search for `some_word` in all pages,
  press <kbd>/</kbd>
  and type `some_word`.
  Navigate through matches pressing <kbd>N</kbd>.
  

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Limit Log Size

To avoid having `git log` cover your entire terminal screen, you can limit the
number of commits that Git lists by using `-N`, where `N` is the number of
commits that you want to view. For example, if you only want information from
the last commit you can use:

```bash
$ git log -1
```

```output
commit 005937fbe2a98fb83f0ade869025dc2636b4dad5 (HEAD -> main)
Author: Vlad Dracula <vlad@tran.sylvan.ia>
Date:   Thu Aug 22 10:14:07 2013 -0400

   Discuss concerns about Mars' climate for Mummy
```

You can also reduce the quantity of information using the
`--oneline` option:

```bash
$ git log --oneline
```

```output
005937f (HEAD -> main) Discuss concerns about Mars' climate for Mummy
34961b1 Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman
f22b25e Start notes on Mars as a base
```

You can also combine the `--oneline` option with others. One useful
combination adds `--graph` to display the commit history as a text-based
graph and to indicate which commits are associated with the
current `HEAD`, the current branch `main`, or
[other Git references][git-references]:

```bash
$ git log --oneline --graph
```

```output
* 005937f (HEAD -> main) Discuss concerns about Mars' climate for Mummy
* 34961b1 Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman
* f22b25e Start notes on Mars as a base
```

## Directories

Two important facts you should know about directories in Git.

1. Git does not track directories on their own, only files within them.
  Try it for yourself:
  
  ```bash
  $ mkdir spaceships
  $ git status
  $ git add spaceships
  $ git status
  ```
  
  Note, our newly created empty directory `spaceships` does not appear in
  the list of untracked files even if we explicitly add it (*via* `git add`) to our
  repository. This is the reason why you will sometimes see `.gitkeep` files
  in otherwise empty directories. Unlike `.gitignore`, these files are not special
  and their sole purpose is to populate a directory so that Git adds it to
  the repository. In fact, you can name such files anything you like.

2. If you create a directory in your Git repository and populate it with files,
  you can add all files in the directory at once by:
  
  ```bash
  git add <directory-with-files>
  ```
  
  Try it for yourself:
  
  ```bash
  $ touch spaceships/apollo-11 spaceships/sputnik-1
  $ git status
  $ git add spaceships
  $ git status
  ```
  
  Before moving on, we will commit these changes.
  
  ```bash
  $ git commit -m "Add some initial thoughts on spaceships"
  ```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

To recap, when we want to add changes to our repository,
we first need to add the changed files to the staging area
(`git add`) and then commit the staged changes to the
repository (`git commit`):

## Choosing a Commit Message

Which of the following commit messages would be most appropriate for the
last commit made to `mars.txt`?

1. "Changes"
2. "Added line 'But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity' to mars.txt"
3. "Discuss effects of Mars' climate on the Mummy"

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

Answer 1 is not descriptive enough, and the purpose of the commit is unclear;
and answer 2 is redundant to using "git diff" to see what changed in this commit;
but answer 3 is good: short, descriptive, and imperative.

## Committing Changes to Git

Which command(s) below would save the changes of `myfile.txt`
to my local Git repository?

1. ```bash
  $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
  ```
2. ```bash
  $ git init myfile.txt
  $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
  ```
3. ```bash
  $ git add myfile.txt
  $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
  ```
4. ```bash
  $ git commit -m myfile.txt "my recent changes"
  ```

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

1. Would only create a commit if files have already been staged.
2. Would try to create a new repository.
3. Is correct: first add the file to the staging area, then commit.
4. Would try to commit a file "my recent changes" with the message myfile.txt.

## Committing Multiple Files

The staging area can hold changes from any number of files
that you want to commit as a single snapshot.

1. Add some text to `mars.txt` noting your decision
  to consider Venus as a base
2. Create a new file `venus.txt` with your initial thoughts
  about Venus as a base for you and your friends
3. Add changes from both files to the staging area,
  and commit those changes.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

The output below from `cat mars.txt` reflects only content added during
this exercise. Your output may vary.

First we make our changes to the `mars.txt` and `venus.txt` files:

```bash
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
```

```output
Maybe I should start with a base on Venus.
```

```bash
$ nano venus.txt
$ cat venus.txt
```

```output
Venus is a nice planet and I definitely should consider it as a base.
```

Now you can add both files to the staging area. We can do that in one line:

```bash
$ git add mars.txt venus.txt
```

Or with multiple commands:

```bash
$ git add mars.txt
$ git add venus.txt
```

Now the files are ready to commit. You can check that using `git status`. If you are ready to commit use:

```bash
$ git commit -m "Write plans to start a base on Venus"
```

```output
[main cc127c2]
 Write plans to start a base on Venus
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 venus.txt

## `bio` Repository

- Create a new Git repository on your computer called `bio`.
- Write a three-line biography for yourself in a file called `me.txt`,
  commit your changes
- Modify one line, add a fourth line
- Display the differences
  between its updated state and its original state.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

If needed, move out of the `planets` folder:

```bash
$ cd ..
```

Create a new folder called `bio` and 'move' into it:

```bash
$ mkdir bio
$ cd bio
```

Initialise git:

```bash
$ git init
```

Create your biography file `me.txt` using `nano` or another text editor.
Once in place, add and commit it to the repository:

```bash
$ git add me.txt
$ git commit -m "Add biography file" 
```

Modify the file as described (modify one line, add a fourth line).
To display the differences
between its updated state and its original state, use `git diff`:

```bash
$ git diff me.txt
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

As we saw in the previous episode, we can refer to commits by their
identifiers.  You can refer to the *most recent commit* of the working
directory by using the identifier `HEAD`.

We've been adding one line at a time to `mars.txt`, so it's easy to track our
progress by looking, so let's do that using our `HEAD`s.  Before we start,
let's make a change to `mars.txt`, adding yet another line.

```bash
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
```

```output
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
An ill-considered change
```

Now, let's see what we get.

```bash
$ git diff HEAD mars.txt
```

```output
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index b36abfd..0848c8d 100644

@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
 Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color

 But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
+An ill-considered change.
```

which is the same as what you would get if you leave out `HEAD` (try it).  The
real goodness in all this is when you can refer to previous commits.  We do
that by adding `~1`
(where "~" is "tilde", pronounced [**til**\-d*uh*])
to refer to the commit one before `HEAD`.

```bash
$ git diff HEAD~1 mars.txt
```

If we want to see the differences between older commits we can use `git diff`
again, but with the notation `HEAD~1`, `HEAD~2`, and so on, to refer to them:

```bash
$ git diff HEAD~3 mars.txt
```

```output
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt

We could also use `git show` which shows us what changes we made at an older commit as
well as the commit message, rather than the *differences* between a commit and our
working directory that we see by using `git diff`.

```bash
$ git show HEAD~3 mars.txt
```

In this way,
we can build up a chain of commits.
The most recent end of the chain is referred to as `HEAD`;
we can refer to previous commits using the `~` notation,
so `HEAD~1`
means "the previous commit",
while `HEAD~123` goes back 123 commits from where we are now.

We can also refer to commits using
those long strings of digits and letters
that `git log` displays.
These are unique IDs for the changes,
and "unique" really does mean unique:
every change to any set of files on any computer
has a unique 40-character identifier.
Our first commit was given the ID
`f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b`,
so let's try this:

```bash
$ git diff f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b mars.txt
```

```output

That's the right answer,
but typing out random 40-character strings is annoying,
so Git lets us use just the first few characters (typically seven for normal size projects):

```bash
$ git diff f22b25e mars.txt
```

```output
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..93a3e13 100644

All right! So
we can save changes to files and see what we've changed. Now, how
can we restore older versions of things?
Let's suppose we change our mind about the last update to
`mars.txt` (the "ill-considered change").

`git status` now tells us that the file has been changed,
but those changes haven't been staged:

```bash
$ git status
```

```output
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

We can put things back the way they were
by using `git checkout`:

```bash
$ git checkout HEAD mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
```

```output
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
```

As you might guess from its name,
`git checkout` checks out (i.e., restores) an old version of a file.
In this case,
we're telling Git that we want to recover the version of the file recorded in `HEAD`,
which is the last saved commit.
If we want to go back even further,
we can use a commit identifier instead:

```bash
$ git checkout f22b25e mars.txt
```

```bash
$ cat mars.txt
```

```output
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
```

```bash
$ git status
```

```output
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

    modified:   mars.txt

```

Notice that the changes are currently in the staging area.
Again, we can put things back the way they were
by using `git checkout`:

```bash
$ git checkout HEAD mars.txt
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Don't Lose Your HEAD

Above we used

```bash
$ git checkout f22b25e mars.txt
```

to revert `mars.txt` to its state after the commit `f22b25e`. But be careful!
The command `checkout` has other important functionalities and Git will misunderstand
your intentions if you are not accurate with the typing. For example,
if you forget `mars.txt` in the previous command.

```bash
$ git checkout f22b25e
```

```error
Note: checking out 'f22b25e'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

 git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at f22b25e Start notes on Mars as a base
```

The "detached HEAD" is like "look, but don't touch" here,
so you shouldn't make any changes in this state.
After investigating your repo's past state, reattach your `HEAD` with `git checkout main`.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

It's important to remember that
we must use the commit number that identifies the state of the repository
*before* the change we're trying to undo.
A common mistake is to use the number of
the commit in which we made the change we're trying to discard.
In the example below, we want to retrieve the state from before the most
recent commit (`HEAD~1`), which is commit `f22b25e`:

![](fig/git-checkout.svg){alt='Git Checkout'}

So, to put it all together,
here's how Git works in cartoon form:

![https://figshare.com/articles/How_Git_works_a_cartoon/1328266](fig/git_staging.svg)

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Simplifying the Common Case

If you read the output of `git status` carefully,
you'll see that it includes this hint:

```output
(use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
```

As it says,
`git checkout` without a version identifier restores files to the state saved in `HEAD`.
The double dash `--` is needed to separate the names of the files being recovered
from the command itself:
without it,
Git would try to use the name of the file as the commit identifier.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The fact that files can be reverted one by one
tends to change the way people organize their work.
If everything is in one large document,
it's hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction
without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion.
If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files,
on the other hand,
moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.

## Recovering Older Versions of a File

Jennifer has made changes to the Python script that she has been working on for weeks, and the
modifications she made this morning "broke" the script and it no longer runs. She has spent
\~ 1hr trying to fix it, with no luck...

Luckily, she has been keeping track of her project's versions using Git! Which commands below will
let her recover the last committed version of her Python script called
`data_cruncher.py`?

1. `$ git checkout HEAD`

2. `$ git checkout HEAD data_cruncher.py`

3. `$ git checkout HEAD~1 data_cruncher.py`

4. `$ git checkout <unique ID of last commit> data_cruncher.py`

5. Both 2 and 4

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

The answer is (5)-Both 2 and 4.

The `checkout` command restores files from the repository, overwriting the files in your working
directory. Answers 2 and 4 both restore the *latest* version *in the repository* of the file
`data_cruncher.py`. Answer 2 uses `HEAD` to indicate the *latest*, whereas answer 4 uses the
unique ID of the last commit, which is what `HEAD` means.

Answer 3 gets the version of `data_cruncher.py` from the commit *before* `HEAD`, which is NOT
what we wanted.

Answer 1 can be dangerous! Without a filename, `git checkout` will restore **all files**
in the current directory (and all directories below it) to their state at the commit specified.
This command will restore `data_cruncher.py` to the latest commit version, but it will also
restore *any other files that are changed* to that version, erasing any changes you may
have made to those files!
As discussed above, you are left in a *detached* `HEAD` state, and you don't want to be there.

## Reverting a Commit

Jennifer is collaborating with colleagues on her Python script.  She
realizes her last commit to the project's repository contained an error, and
wants to undo it.  Jennifer wants to undo correctly so everyone in the project's
repository gets the correct change. The command `git revert [erroneous commit ID]` will create a
new commit that reverses the erroneous commit.

The command `git revert` is
different from `git checkout [commit ID]` because `git checkout` returns the
files not yet committed within the local repository to a previous state, whereas `git revert`
reverses changes committed to the local and project repositories.

Below are the right steps and explanations for Jennifer to use `git revert`,
what is the missing command?

1. `________ # Look at the git history of the project to find the commit ID`

2. Copy the ID (the first few characters of the ID, e.g. 0b1d055).

3. `git revert [commit ID]`

4. Type in the new commit message.

5. Save and close

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

The command `git log` lists project history with commit IDs.

The command `git show HEAD` shows changes made at the latest commit, and lists
the commit ID; however, Jennifer should double-check it is the correct commit, and no one
else has committed changes to the repository.

## Understanding Workflow and History

What is the output of the last command in

```bash
$ cd planets
$ echo "Venus is beautiful and full of love" > venus.txt
$ git add venus.txt
$ echo "Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base" >> venus.txt
$ git commit -m "Comment on Venus as an unsuitable base"
$ git checkout HEAD venus.txt
$ cat venus.txt #this will print the contents of venus.txt to the screen
```

1. ```output
  Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base
  ```
2. ```output
  Venus is beautiful and full of love
  ```
3. ```output
  Venus is beautiful and full of love
  Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base
  ```
4. ```output
  Error because you have changed venus.txt without committing the changes
  ```

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

The answer is 2.

The command `git add venus.txt` places the current version of `venus.txt` into the staging area.
The changes to the file from the second `echo` command are only applied to the working copy,
not the version in the staging area.

So, when `git commit -m "Comment on Venus as an unsuitable base"` is executed,
the version of `venus.txt` committed to the repository is the one from the staging area and
has only one line.

At this time, the working copy still has the second line (and
`git status` will show that the file is modified). However, `git checkout HEAD venus.txt`
replaces the working copy with the most recently committed version of `venus.txt`.

So, `cat venus.txt` will output

```output
Venus is beautiful and full of love.
```

## Checking Understanding of `git diff`

Consider this command: `git diff HEAD~9 mars.txt`. What do you predict this command
will do if you execute it? What happens when you do execute it? Why?

Try another command, `git diff [ID] mars.txt`, where [ID] is replaced with
the unique identifier for your most recent commit. What do you think will happen,
and what does happen?

## Getting Rid of Staged Changes

`git checkout` can be used to restore a previous commit when unstaged changes have
been made, but will it also work for changes that have been staged but not committed?
Make a change to `mars.txt`, add that change using `git add`,
then use `git checkout` to see if you can remove your change.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

After adding a change, `git checkout` can not be used directly.
Let's look at the output of `git status`:

```output
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   mars.txt

```

Note that if you don't have the same output
you may either have forgotten to change the file,
or you have added it *and* committed it.

Using the command `git checkout -- mars.txt` now does not give an error,
but it does not restore the file either.
Git helpfully tells us that we need to use `git reset` first
to unstage the file:

```bash
$ git reset HEAD mars.txt
```

```output
Unstaged changes after reset:
M	mars.txt
```

Now, `git status` gives us:

```bash
$ git status
```

```output
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

This means we can now use `git checkout` to restore the file
to the previous commit:

```bash
$ git checkout -- mars.txt
$ git status
```

```output
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Explore and Summarize Histories

Exploring history is an important part of Git, and often it is a challenge to find
the right commit ID, especially if the commit is from several months ago.

Imagine the `planets` project has more than 50 files.
You would like to find a commit that modifies some specific text in `mars.txt`.
When you type `git log`, a very long list appeared.
How can you narrow down the search?

Recall that the `git diff` command allows us to explore one specific file,
e.g., `git diff mars.txt`. We can apply a similar idea here.

```bash
$ git log mars.txt
```

Unfortunately some of these commit messages are very ambiguous, e.g., `update files`.
How can you search through these files?

Both `git diff` and `git log` are very useful and they summarize a different part of the history
for you.
Is it possible to combine both? Let's try the following:

```bash
$ git log --patch mars.txt
```

You should get a long list of output, and you should be able to see both commit messages and
the difference between each commit.

Question: What does the following command do?

```bash
$ git log --patch HEAD~9 *.txt
```

# Ignoring Things

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Configure Git to ignore specific files.
- Explain why ignoring files can be useful.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How can I tell Git to ignore files I don't want to track?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

What if we have files that we do not want Git to track for us,
like backup files created by our editor
or intermediate files created during data analysis?
Let's create a few dummy files:

```bash
$ mkdir results
$ touch a.dat b.dat c.dat results/a.out results/b.out
```

and see what Git says:

```bash
$ git status
```

```output
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	a.dat
	b.dat
	c.dat
	results/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Putting these files under version control would be a waste of disk space.
What's worse,
having them all listed could distract us from changes that actually matter,
so let's tell Git to ignore them.

We do this by creating a file in the root directory of our project called `.gitignore`:

```bash
$ nano .gitignore
$ cat .gitignore
```

```output
*.dat
results/
```

These patterns tell Git to ignore any file whose name ends in `.dat`
and everything in the `results` directory.
(If any of these files were already being tracked,
Git would continue to track them.)

Once we have created this file,
the output of `git status` is much cleaner:

```bash
$ git status
```

```output
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	.gitignore

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

The only thing Git notices now is the newly-created `.gitignore` file.
You might think we wouldn't want to track it,
but everyone we're sharing our repository with will probably want to ignore
the same things that we're ignoring.
Let's add and commit `.gitignore`:

```bash
$ git add .gitignore
$ git commit -m "Ignore data files and the results folder"
$ git status
```

```output
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

As a bonus, using `.gitignore` helps us avoid accidentally adding files to the repository that we don't want to track:

```bash
$ git add a.dat
```

```output
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
a.dat
Use -f if you really want to add them.
```

If we really want to override our ignore settings,
we can use `git add -f` to force Git to add something. For example,
`git add -f a.dat`.
We can also always see the status of ignored files if we want:

```bash
$ git status --ignored
```

```output
On branch main
Ignored files:
 (use "git add -f <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        a.dat
        b.dat
        c.dat
        results/

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Ignoring Nested Files

Given a directory structure that looks like:

```bash
results/data
results/plots
```

How would you ignore only `results/plots` and not `results/data`?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

If you only want to ignore the contents of
`results/plots`, you can change your `.gitignore` to ignore
only the `/plots/` subfolder by adding the following line to
your .gitignore:

```output
results/plots/
```

This line will ensure only the contents of `results/plots` is ignored, and
not the contents of `results/data`.

As with most programming issues, there
are a few alternative ways that one may ensure this ignore rule is followed.
The "Ignoring Nested Files: Variation" exercise has a slightly
different directory structure
that presents an alternative solution.
Further, the discussion page has more detail on ignore rules.

## Including Specific Files

How would you ignore all `.dat` files in your root directory except for
`final.dat`?
Hint: Find out what `!` (the exclamation point operator) does

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

You would add the following two lines to your .gitignore:

```output
*.dat           # ignore all data files
!final.dat      # except final.data
```

The exclamation point operator will include a previously excluded entry.

Note also that because you've previously committed `.dat` files in this
lesson they will not be ignored with this new rule. Only future additions
of `.dat` files added to the root directory will be ignored.

## Ignoring Nested Files: Variation

Given a directory structure that looks similar to the earlier Nested Files
exercise, but with a slightly different directory structure:

```bash
results/data
results/images
results/plots
results/analysis
```

How would you ignore all of the contents in the results folder, but not `results/data`?

Hint: think a bit about how you created an exception with the `!` operator
before.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

If you want to ignore the contents of
`results/` but not those of `results/data/`, you can change your `.gitignore` to ignore
the contents of results folder, but create an exception for the contents of the
`results/data` subfolder. Your .gitignore would look like this:

```output
results/*               # ignore everything in results folder
!results/data/          # do not ignore results/data/ contents
```

## Ignoring all data Files in a Directory

Assuming you have an empty .gitignore file, and given a directory structure that looks like:

results/data/position/gps/c.dat
results/data/position/gps/info.txt
results/plots
```

What's the shortest `.gitignore` rule you could write to ignore all `.dat`
files in `result/data/position/gps`? Do not ignore the `info.txt`.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

Appending `results/data/position/gps/*.dat` will match every file in `results/data/position/gps`
that ends with `.dat`.
The file `results/data/position/gps/info.txt` will not be ignored.

## Ignoring all data Files in the repository

Let us assume you have many `.dat` files in different subdirectories of your repository.
For example, you might have:

```bash
results/a.dat
data/experiment_1/b.dat
data/experiment_2/c.dat
data/experiment_2/variation_1/d.dat
```

How do you ignore all the `.dat` files, without explicitly listing the names of the corresponding folders?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

In the `.gitignore` file, write:

```output
**/*.dat               
```

This will ignore all the `.dat` files, regardless of their position in the directory tree.
You can still include some specific exception with the exclamation point operator.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## The Order of Rules

Given a `.gitignore` file with the following contents:

```bash
*.dat
!*.dat
```

What will be the result?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

The `!` modifier will negate an entry from a previously defined ignore pattern.
Because the `!*.dat` entry negates all of the previous `.dat` files in the `.gitignore`,
none of them will be ignored, and all `.dat` files will be tracked.

You want to keep them but you do not want to track them through `git`.

1. Write **one** `.gitignore` entry that excludes files of the form `log_01`, `log_02`, etc.

2. Test your "ignore pattern" by creating some dummy files of the form `log_01`, etc.

3. You find that the file `log_01` is very important after all, add it to the tracked files without changing the `.gitignore` again.

4. Discuss with your neighbor what other types of files could reside in your directory that you do not want to track and thus would exclude via `.gitignore`.

:::::::::::::::  solution

1. append either `log_*`  or  `log*`  as a new entry in your .gitignore
2. track `log_01` using   `git add -f log_01`

# Remotes in GitHub

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Explain what remote repositories are and why they are useful.
- Push to or pull from a remote repository.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How do I share my changes with others on the web?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Version control really comes into its own when we begin to collaborate with
other people.  We already have most of the machinery we need to do this; the
only thing missing is to copy changes from one repository to another.

Systems like Git allow us to move work between any two repositories.  In
practice, though, it's easiest to use one copy as a central hub, and to keep it
on the web rather than on someone's laptop.  Most programmers use hosting
services like [GitHub](https://github.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) or
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) to hold those main copies; we'll explore the pros
and cons of this in a [later episode](13-hosting.md).

Let's start by sharing the changes we've made to our current project with the
world. To this end we are going to create a *remote* repository that will be linked to our *local* repository.

## 1\. Create a remote repository

Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com), then click on the icon in the top right corner to
create a new repository called `planets`:

![](fig/github-create-repo-01.png){alt='Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 1)'}

Name your repository "planets" and then click "Create Repository".

Note: Since this repository will be connected to a local repository, it needs to be empty. Leave
"Initialize this repository with a README" unchecked, and keep "None" as options for both "Add
.gitignore" and "Add a license." See the "GitHub License and README files" exercise below for a full
explanation of why the repository needs to be empty.

![](fig/github-create-repo-02.png){alt='Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 2)'}

As soon as the repository is created, GitHub displays a page with a URL and some
information on how to configure your local repository:

![](fig/github-create-repo-03.png){alt='Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 3)'}

This effectively does the following on GitHub's servers:

```bash
$ mkdir planets
$ cd planets
$ git init
```

If you remember back to the earlier [episode](04-changes.md) where we added and
committed our earlier work on `mars.txt`, we had a diagram of the local repository
which looked like this:

![](fig/git-staging-area.svg){alt='The Local Repository with Git Staging Area'}

Now that we have two repositories, we need a diagram like this:

![](fig/git-freshly-made-github-repo.svg){alt='Freshly-Made GitHub Repository'}

Note that our local repository still contains our earlier work on `mars.txt`, but the
remote repository on GitHub appears empty as it doesn't contain any files yet.

## 2\. Connect local to remote repository

Now we connect the two repositories.  We do this by making the
GitHub repository a [remote](../learners/reference.md#remote) for the local repository.
The home page of the repository on GitHub includes the URL string we need to
identify it:

![](fig/github-find-repo-string.png){alt='Where to Find Repository URL on GitHub'}

Click on the 'SSH' link to change the [protocol](../learners/reference.md#protocol) from HTTPS to SSH.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## HTTPS vs. SSH

We use SSH here because, while it requires some additional configuration, it is a
security protocol widely used by many applications.  The steps below describe SSH at a
minimum level for GitHub. 


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

![](fig/github-change-repo-string.png){alt='Changing the Repository URL on GitHub'}

Copy that URL from the browser, go into the local `planets` repository, and run
this command:

```bash
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:vlad/planets.git
```

Make sure to use the URL for your repository rather than Vlad's: the only
difference should be your username instead of `vlad`.

`origin` is a local name used to refer to the remote repository. It could be called
anything, but `origin` is a convention that is often used by default in git
and GitHub, so it's helpful to stick with this unless there's a reason not to.

We can check that the command has worked by running `git remote -v`:

```bash
$ git remote -v
```

```output
origin   git@github.com:vlad/planets.git (fetch)
origin   git@github.com:vlad/planets.git (push)
```

We'll discuss remotes in more detail in the next episode, while
talking about how they might be used for collaboration.

## 3\. SSH Background and Setup

Before Dracula can connect to a remote repository, he needs to set up a way for his computer to authenticate with GitHub so it knows it's him trying to connect to his remote repository.

We are going to set up the method that is commonly used by many different services to authenticate access on the command line.  This method is called Secure Shell Protocol (SSH).  SSH is a cryptographic network protocol that allows secure communication between computers using an otherwise insecure network.

SSH uses what is called a key pair. This is two keys that work together to validate access. One key is publicly known and called the public key, and the other key called the private key is kept private. Very descriptive names.

You can think of the public key as a padlock, and only you have the key (the private key) to open it. You use the public key where you want a secure method of communication, such as your GitHub account.  You give this padlock, or public key, to GitHub and say "lock the communications to my account with this so that only computers that have my private key can unlock communications and send git commands as my GitHub account."

What we will do now is the minimum required to set up the SSH keys and add the public key to a GitHub account.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Advanced SSH

A supplemental episode in this lesson discusses SSH and key pairs in more depth and detail.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The first thing we are going to do is check if this has already been done on the computer you're on.  Because generally speaking, this setup only needs to happen once and then you can forget about it.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Keeping your keys secure

You shouldn't really forget about your SSH keys, since they keep your account secure. It's good
practice to audit your secure shell keys every so often. Especially if you are using multiple
computers to access your account.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We will run the list command to check what key pairs already exist on your computer.

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

Your output is going to look a little different depending on whether or not SSH has ever been set up on the computer you are using.

Dracula has not set up SSH on his computer, so his output is

```output
ls: cannot access '/c/Users/Vlad Dracula/.ssh': No such file or directory
```

If SSH has been set up on the computer you're using, the public and private key pairs will be listed. The file names are either `id_ed25519`/`id_ed25519.pub` or `id_rsa`/`id_rsa.pub` depending on how the key pairs were set up.  
Since they don't exist on Dracula's computer, he uses this command to create them.

### 3\.1 Create an SSH key pair

To create an SSH key pair Vlad uses this command, where the `-t` option specifies which type of algorithm to use and `-C` attaches a comment to the key (here, Vlad's email):

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "vlad@tran.sylvan.ia"
```

If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:
`$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`

```output
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/Vlad Dracula/.ssh/id_ed25519):
```

We want to use the default file, so just press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

```output
Created directory '/c/Users/Vlad Dracula/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
```

Now, it is prompting Dracula for a passphrase.  Since he is using his lab's laptop that other people sometimes have access to, he wants to create a passphrase.  Be sure to use something memorable or save your passphrase somewhere, as there is no "reset my password" option.

```output
Enter same passphrase again:
```

After entering the same passphrase a second time, we receive the confirmation

```output
Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/Vlad Dracula/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/Vlad Dracula/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:SMSPIStNyA00KPxuYu94KpZgRAYjgt9g4BA4kFy3g1o vlad@tran.sylvan.ia
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|^B== o.          |
|%*=.*.+          |
|+=.E =.+         |
| .=.+.o..        |
|....  . S        |
|.+ o             |
|+ =              |
|.o.o             |
|oo+.             |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

The "identification" is actually the private key. You should never share it.  The public key is appropriately named.  The "key fingerprint"
is a shorter version of a public key.

Now that we have generated the SSH keys, we will find the SSH files when we check.

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

```output
drwxr-xr-x 1 Vlad Dracula 197121   0 Jul 16 14:48 ./
drwxr-xr-x 1 Vlad Dracula 197121   0 Jul 16 14:48 ../
-rw-r--r-- 1 Vlad Dracula 197121 419 Jul 16 14:48 id_ed25519
-rw-r--r-- 1 Vlad Dracula 197121 106 Jul 16 14:48 id_ed25519.pub
```

### 3\.2 Copy the public key to GitHub

Now we have a SSH key pair and we can run this command to check if GitHub can read our authentication.

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

```output
The authenticity of host 'github.com (192.30.255.112)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? y
Please type 'yes', 'no' or the fingerprint: yes
Warning: Permanently added 'github.com' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
```

Right, we forgot that we need to give GitHub our public key!

First, we need to copy the public key.  Be sure to include the `.pub` at the end, otherwise you're looking at the private key.

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

```output
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIDmRA3d51X0uu9wXek559gfn6UFNF69yZjChyBIU2qKI vlad@tran.sylvan.ia
```

Now, going to GitHub.com, click on your profile icon in the top right corner to get the drop-down menu.  Click "Settings," then on the
settings page, click "SSH and GPG keys," on the left side "Account settings" menu.  Click the "New SSH key" button on the right side. Now,
you can add the title (Dracula uses the title "Vlad's Lab Laptop" so he can remember where the original key pair
files are located), paste your SSH key into the field, and click the "Add SSH key" to complete the setup.

Now that we've set that up, let's check our authentication again from the command line.

```bash
$ ssh -T git@github.com
```

```output
Hi Vlad! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

Good! This output confirms that the SSH key works as intended. We are now ready to push our work to the remote repository.

## 4\. Push local changes to a remote

Now that authentication is setup, we can return to the remote.  This command will push the changes from
our local repository to the repository on GitHub:

```bash
$ git push origin main
```

Since Dracula set up a passphrase, it will prompt him for it.  If you completed advanced settings for your authentication, it
will not prompt for a passphrase.

last command failed with "Could not resolve hostname" as the error message. To
solve this issue, you need to tell Git about the proxy:

```bash
$ git config --global http.proxy http://user:password@proxy.url
$ git config --global https.proxy https://user:password@proxy.url
```

When you connect to another network that doesn't use a proxy, you will need to
tell Git to disable the proxy using:

```bash
$ git config --global --unset http.proxy
$ git config --global --unset https.proxy
```

## Password Managers

If your operating system has a password manager configured, `git push` will
try to use it when it needs your username and password.  For example, this
is the default behavior for Git Bash on Windows. If you want to type your
username and password at the terminal instead of using a password manager,
type:

```bash
$ unset SSH_ASKPASS
```

in the terminal, before you run `git push`.  Despite the name, [Git uses
`SSH_ASKPASS` for all credential
entry](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials#_requesting_credentials), so
you may want to unset `SSH_ASKPASS` whether you are using Git via SSH or
https.

You may also want to add `unset SSH_ASKPASS` at the end of your `~/.bashrc`
to make Git default to using the terminal for usernames and passwords.

Our local and remote repositories are now in this state:

## The '-u' Flag

You may see a `-u` option used with `git push` in some documentation.  This
option is synonymous with the `--set-upstream-to` option for the `git branch`
command, and is used to associate the current branch with a remote branch so
that the `git pull` command can be used without any arguments. To do this,
simply use `git push -u origin main` once the remote has been set up.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We can pull changes from the remote repository to the local one as well:

```bash
$ git pull origin main
```

```output
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            main     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up-to-date.
```

Pulling has no effect in this case because the two repositories are already
synchronized.  If someone else had pushed some changes to the repository on
GitHub, though, this command would download them to our local repository.

## GitHub GUI

Browse to your `planets` repository on GitHub.
Underneath the Code button, find and click on the text that says "XX commits" (where "XX" is some number).
Hover over, and click on, the three buttons to the right of each commit.
What information can you gather/explore from these buttons?
How would you get that same information in the shell?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

The left-most button (with the picture of a clipboard) copies the full identifier of the commit
to the clipboard. In the shell, `git log` will show you the full commit identifier for each
commit.

When you click on the middle button, you'll see all of the changes that were made in that
particular commit. Green shaded lines indicate additions and red ones removals. In the shell we
can do the same thing with `git diff`. In particular, `git diff ID1..ID2` where ID1 and
ID2 are commit identifiers (e.g. `git diff a3bf1e5..041e637`) will show the differences
between those two commits.

The right-most button lets you view all of the files in the repository at the time of that
commit. To do this in the shell, we'd need to checkout the repository at that particular time.
We can do this with `git checkout ID` where ID is the identifier of the commit we want to
look at. If we do this, we need to remember to put the repository back to the right state
afterwards!

## Uploading files directly in GitHub browser

Github also allows you to skip the command line and upload files directly to
your repository without having to leave the browser. There are two options.
First you can click the "Upload files" button in the toolbar at the top of the
file tree. Or, you can drag and drop files from your desktop onto the file
tree. You can read more about this [on this GitHub page](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/).

## GitHub Timestamp

Create a remote repository on GitHub. Push the contents of your local
repository to the remote. Make changes to your local repository and push these
changes. Go to the repo you just created on GitHub and check the
[timestamps](../learners/reference.md#timestamp) of the files. How does GitHub
record times, and why?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

GitHub displays timestamps in a human readable relative format (i.e. "22 hours ago" or "three
weeks ago"). However, if you hover over the timestamp, you can see the exact time at which the
last change to the file occurred.

## Push vs. Commit

In this episode, we introduced the "git push" command.
How is "git push" different from "git commit"?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

When we push changes, we're interacting with a remote repository to update it with the changes
we've made locally (often this corresponds to sharing the changes we've made with others).
Commit only updates your local repository.

## GitHub License and README files

In this episode we learned about creating a remote repository on GitHub, but when you initialized
your GitHub repo, you didn't add a README.md or a license file. If you had, what do you think
would have happened when you tried to link your local and remote repositories?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

In this case, we'd see a merge conflict due to unrelated histories. When GitHub creates a
README.md file, it performs a commit in the remote repository. When you try to pull the remote
repository to your local repository, Git detects that they have histories that do not share a
common origin and refuses to merge.

```bash
$ git pull origin main
```

```output
warning: no common commits
remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            main     -> FETCH_HEAD
 * [new branch]      main     -> origin/main
fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
```

You can force git to merge the two repositories with the option `--allow-unrelated-histories`.
Be careful when you use this option and carefully examine the contents of local and remote
repositories before merging.

```bash
$ git pull --allow-unrelated-histories origin main
```

```output
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            main     -> FETCH_HEAD
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
