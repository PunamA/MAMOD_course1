<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Humans and computers commonly interact in many different ways, such
as through a keyboard and mouse, touch screen interfaces, or using
speech recognition systems. The most widely used way to interact with
personal computers is called a <strong>graphical user interface</strong>
(GUI). With a GUI, we give instructions by clicking a mouse and using
menu-driven interactions.</p>
<p>While the visual aid of a GUI makes it intuitive to learn, this way
of delivering instructions to a computer scales very poorly. Imagine the
following task: for a literature search, you have to copy the third line
of one thousand text files in one thousand different directories and
paste it into a single file. Using a GUI, you would not only be clicking
at your desk for several hours, but you could potentially also commit an
error in the process of completing this repetitive task. This is where
we take advantage of the Unix shell. The Unix shell is both a
<strong>command-line interface</strong> (CLI) and a scripting language,
allowing such repetitive tasks to be done automatically and fast. With
the proper commands, the shell can repeat tasks with or without some
modification as many times as we want. Using the shell, the task in the
literature example can be accomplished in seconds.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-shell" class="section level3">
<h3>The Shell</h3>
<p>The shell is a program where users can type commands. With the shell,
it’s possible to invoke complicated programs like climate modeling
software or simple commands that create an empty directory with only one
line of code. The most popular Unix shell is Bash (the Bourne Again
SHell — so-called because it’s derived from a shell written by Stephen
Bourne). Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of
Unix and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows. Note
that ‘Git Bash’ is a piece of software that enables Windows users to use
a Bash like interface when interacting with Git.</p>
<p>Using the shell will take some effort and some time to learn. While a
GUI presents you with choices to select, CLI choices are not
automatically presented to you, so you must learn a few commands like
new vocabulary in a language you’re studying. However, unlike a spoken
language, a small number of “words” (i.e. commands) gets you a long way,
and we’ll cover those essential few today.</p>
<p>The grammar of a shell allows you to combine existing tools into
powerful pipelines and handle large volumes of data automatically.
Sequences of commands can be written into a <em>script</em>, improving
the reproducibility of workflows.</p>
<p>In addition, the command line is often the easiest way to interact
with remote machines and supercomputers. Familiarity with the shell is
near essential to run a variety of specialized tools and resources
including high-performance computing systems. As clusters and cloud
computing systems become more popular for scientific data crunching,
being able to interact with the shell is becoming a necessary skill. We
can build on the command-line skills covered here to tackle a wide range
of scientific questions and computational challenges.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<p>When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a
<strong>prompt</strong>, indicating that the shell is waiting for
input.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$</code></pre>
<p>The shell typically uses <code>$</code> as the prompt, but may use a
different symbol. In the examples for this lesson, we’ll show the prompt
as <code>$</code>. Most importantly, <em>do not type the prompt</em>
when typing commands. Only type the command that follows the prompt.
This rule applies both in these lessons and in lessons from other
sources. Also note that after you type a command, you have to press the
<kbd>Enter</kbd> key to execute it.</p>
<p>The prompt is followed by a <strong>text cursor</strong>, a character
that indicates the position where your typing will appear. The cursor is
usually a flashing or solid block, but it can also be an underscore or a
pipe. You may have seen it in a text editor program, for example.</p>
<p>Note that your prompt might look a little different. In particular,
most popular shell environments by default put your user name and the
host name before the <code>$</code>. Such a prompt might look like,
e.g.:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>nelle@localhost $</code></pre>
<p>The prompt might even include more than this. Do not worry if your
prompt is not just a short <code>$</code>. This lesson does not depend
on this additional information and it should also not get in your way.
The only important item to focus on is the <code>$</code> character
itself and we will see later why.</p>
<p>So let’s try our first command, <code>ls</code>, which is short for
listing. This command will list the contents of the current
directory:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Desktop     Downloads   Movies      Pictures
Documents   Library     Music       Public</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="command-not-found" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Command not found</h2>
<p>If the shell can’t find a program whose name is the command you
typed, it will print an error message such as:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ks</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>ks: command not found</code></pre>
<p>This might happen if the command was mis-typed or if the program
corresponding to that command is not installed.</p>
</div>
<div id="nelles-pipeline-a-typical-problem" class="section level2">
<h2>Nelle’s Pipeline: A Typical Problem</h2>
<p>Nelle Nemo, a marine biologist, has just returned from a six-month
survey of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre">North Pacific
Gyre</a>, where she has been sampling gelatinous marine life in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch">Great
Pacific Garbage Patch</a>. She has 1520 samples that she’s run through
an assay machine to measure the relative abundance of 300 proteins. She
needs to run these 1520 files through an imaginary program called
<code>goostats.sh</code>. In addition to this huge task, she has to
write up results by the end of the month, so her paper can appear in a
special issue of <em>Aquatic Goo Letters</em>.</p>
<p>If Nelle chooses to run <code>goostats.sh</code> by hand using a GUI,
she’ll have to select and open a file 1520 times. If
<code>goostats.sh</code> takes 30 seconds to run each file, the whole
process will take more than 12 hours of Nelle’s attention. With the
shell, Nelle can instead assign her computer this mundane task while she
focuses her attention on writing her paper.</p>
<p>The next few lessons will explore the ways Nelle can achieve this.
More specifically, the lessons explain how she can use a command shell
to run the <code>goostats.sh</code> program, using loops to automate the
repetitive steps of entering file names, so that her computer can work
while she writes her paper.</p>
<p>As a bonus, once she has put a processing pipeline together, she will
be able to use it again whenever she collects more data.</p>
<p>In order to achieve her task, Nelle needs to know how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>navigate to a file/directory</li>
<li>create a file/directory</li>
<li>check the length of a file</li>
<li>chain commands together</li>
<li>retrieve a set of files</li>
<li>iterate over files</li>
<li>run a shell script containing her pipeline</li>
</ul>
<div class="keypoints">
<ul>
<li>A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and
run other programs.</li>
<li>This lesson uses Bash, the default shell in many implementations of
Unix.</li>
<li>Programs can be run in Bash by entering commands at the command-line
prompt.</li>
<li>The shell’s main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio,
its support for automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to access
networked machines.</li>
<li>A significant challenge when using the shell can be knowing what
commands need to be run and how to run them.</li>

<p>- Translate an absolute path into a relative path and vice versa.</p>
<p>- Construct absolute and relative paths that identify specific files

<div class="questions">
<p>- How can I move around on my computer?</p>
<p>- How can I see what files and directories I have?</p>
<p>- How can I specify the location of a file or directory on my
computer?</p>
</div>
<p>The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and
directories is called the <strong>file system</strong>. It organizes our
data into files, which hold information, and directories (also called
‘folders’), which hold files or other directories.</p>
<p>Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and
delete files and directories. To start exploring them, we’ll go to our
open shell window.</p>
<p>First, let’s find out where we are by running a command called
<code>pwd</code> (which stands for ‘print working directory’).
Directories are like <em>places</em> â at any time while we are using
the shell, we are in exactly one place called our <strong>current
working directory</strong>. Commands mostly read and write files in the
current working directory, i.e. ‘here’, so knowing where you are before
running a command is important. <code>pwd</code> shows you where you
are:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ pwd</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>/Users/nelle</code></pre>
<p>Here, the computer’s response is <code>/Users/nelle</code>, which is
Nelle’s <strong>home directory</strong>:</p>
<div id="home-directory-variation" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Home Directory Variation</h2>
<p>The home directory path will look different on different operating
systems. On Linux, it may look like <code>/home/nelle</code>, and on
Windows, it will be similar to
<code>C:\Documents and Settings\nelle</code> or
<code>C:\Users\nelle</code>. (Note that it may look slightly different
for different versions of Windows.) In future examples, we’ve used Mac
output as the default - Linux and Windows output may differ slightly but
should be generally similar.</p>
<p>We will also assume that your <code>pwd</code> command returns your
user’s home directory. If <code>pwd</code> returns something different,
you may need to navigate there using <code>cd</code> or some commands in
this lesson will not work as written. See <a
href="#exploring-other-directories">Exploring Other Directories</a> for
more details on the <code>cd</code> command.</p>
</div>
<p>To understand what a ‘home directory’ is, let’s have a look at how
the file system as a whole is organized. For the sake of this example,
we’ll be illustrating the filesystem on our scientist Nelle’s computer.
After this illustration, you’ll be learning commands to explore your own
filesystem, which will be constructed in a similar way, but not be
exactly identical.</p>
<p>On Nelle’s computer, the filesystem looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/filesystem.svg"
alt="The file system is made up of a root directory that contains sub-directoriestitled bin, data, users, and tmp" /></p>
<p>The filesystem looks like an upside down tree. The topmost directory
is the <strong>root directory</strong> that holds everything else. We
refer to it using a slash character, <code>/</code>, on its own; this
character is the leading slash in <code>/Users/nelle</code>.</p>
<p>Inside that directory are several other directories: <code>bin</code>
(which is where some built-in programs are stored), <code>data</code>
(for miscellaneous data files), <code>Users</code> (where users’
personal directories are located), <code>tmp</code> (for temporary files
that don’t need to be stored long-term), and so on.</p>
<p>We know that our current working directory <code>/Users/nelle</code>
is stored inside <code>/Users</code> because <code>/Users</code> is the
first part of its name. Similarly, we know that <code>/Users</code> is
stored inside the root directory <code>/</code> because its name begins
with <code>/</code>.</p>
<div id="slashes" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Slashes</h2>
<p>Notice that there are two meanings for the <code>/</code> character.
When it appears at the front of a file or directory name, it refers to
the root directory. When it appears <em>inside</em> a path, it’s just a
separator.</p>
</div>
<p>Underneath <code>/Users</code>, we find one directory for each user
with an account on Nelle’s machine, her colleagues <em>imhotep</em> and
<em>larry</em>.</p>
<p><img src="images/home-directories.svg"
alt="Like other directories, home directories are sub-directories underneath&quot;/Users&quot; like &quot;/Users/imhotep&quot;, &quot;/Users/larry&quot; or&quot;/Users/nelle&quot;" /></p>
<p>The user <em>imhotep</em>’s files are stored in
<code>/Users/imhotep</code>, user <em>larry</em>’s in
<code>/Users/larry</code>, and Nelle’s in <code>/Users/nelle</code>.
Nelle is the user in our examples here; therefore, we get
<code>/Users/nelle</code> as our home directory. Typically, when you
open a new command prompt, you will be in your home directory to
start.</p>
<p>Now let’s learn the command that will let us see the contents of our
own filesystem. We can see what’s in our home directory by running
<code>ls</code>:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Applications Documents    Library      Music        Public
Desktop      Downloads    Movies       Pictures</code></pre>
<p>(Again, your results may be slightly different depending on your
operating system and how you have customized your filesystem.)</p>
<p><code>ls</code> prints the names of the files and directories in the
current directory. We can make its output more comprehensible by using
the <code>-F</code> <strong>option</strong> which tells <code>ls</code>
to classify the output by adding a marker to file and directory names to
indicate what they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a trailing <code>/</code> indicates that this is a directory</li>
<li><code>@</code> indicates a link</li>
<li><code>*</code> indicates an executable</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on your shell’s default settings, the shell might also use
colors to indicate whether each entry is a file or directory.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls -F</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Applications/ Documents/    Library/      Music/        Public/
Desktop/      Downloads/    Movies/       Pictures/</code></pre>
<p>Here, we can see that the home directory contains only
<strong>sub-directories</strong>. Any names in the output that don’t
have a classification symbol are <strong>files</strong> in the current
working directory.</p>
<div id="clearing-your-terminal" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Clearing your terminal</h2>
<p>If your screen gets too cluttered, you can clear your terminal using
the <code>clear</code> command. You can still access previous commands
using <kbd>â’</kbd> and <kbd>â“</kbd> to move line-by-line, or by
scrolling in your terminal.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-help" class="section level3">
<h3>Getting help</h3>
<p><code>ls</code> has lots of other <strong>options</strong>. There are
two common ways to find out how to use a command and what options it
accepts — <strong>depending on your environment, you might find that
only one of these ways works:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We can pass a <code>--help</code> option to any command (available
on Linux and Git Bash), for example:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls --help</code></pre>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We can read its manual with <code>man</code> (available on Linux and
macOS):</li>
</ol>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ man ls</code></pre>
<p>We’ll describe both ways next.</p>
</div>
<div id="help-for-built-in-commands" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Help for built-in commands</h2>
<p>Some commands are built in to the Bash shell, rather than existing as
separate programs on the filesystem. One example is the <code>cd</code>
(change directory) command. If you get a message like
<code>No manual entry for cd</code>, try <code>help cd</code> instead.
The <code>help</code> command is how you get usage information for <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Builtins.html">Bash
built-ins</a>.</p>

<div id="exploring-other-directories" class="section level3">
<h3>Exploring Other Directories</h3>
<p>Not only can we use <code>ls</code> on the current working directory,
but we can use it to list the contents of a different directory. Let’s
take a look at our <code>Desktop</code> directory by running
<code>ls -F Desktop</code>, i.e., the command <code>ls</code> with the
<code>-F</code> <strong>option</strong> and the <a
href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/reference.html#argument"><strong>argument</strong></a>
<code>Desktop</code>. The argument <code>Desktop</code> tells
<code>ls</code> that we want a listing of something other than our
current working directory:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls -F Desktop</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>shell-lesson-data/</code></pre>
<p>Note that if a directory named <code>Desktop</code> does not exist in
your current working directory, this command will return an error.
Typically, a <code>Desktop</code> directory exists in your home
directory, which we assume is the current working directory of your bash
shell.</p>
<p>Your output should be a list of all the files and sub-directories in
your Desktop directory, including the <code>shell-lesson-data</code>
directory you downloaded at the <a href="../learners/setup.md">setup for
this lesson</a>. (On most systems, the contents of the
<code>Desktop</code> directory in the shell will show up as icons in a
graphical user interface behind all the open windows. See if this is the
case for you.)</p>
<p>Organizing things hierarchically helps us keep track of our work.
While it’s possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory just
as it’s possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk, it’s
much easier to find things when they’ve been organized into
sensibly-named subdirectories.</p>
<p>Now that we know the <code>shell-lesson-data</code> directory is
located in our Desktop directory, we can do two things.</p>
<p>First, using the same strategy as before, we can look at its contents
by passing a directory name to <code>ls</code>:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls -F Desktop/shell-lesson-data</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>exercise-data/  north-pacific-gyre/</code></pre>
<p>Second, we can actually change our location to a different directory,
so we are no longer located in our home directory.</p>
<p>The command to change locations is <code>cd</code> followed by a
directory name to change our working directory. <code>cd</code> stands
for ‘change directory’, which is a bit misleading. The command doesn’t
change the directory; it changes the shell’s current working directory.
In other words it changes the shell’s settings for what directory we are
in. The <code>cd</code> command is akin to double-clicking a folder in a
graphical interface to get into that folder.</p>
<p>Let’s say we want to move into the <code>exercise-data</code>
directory we saw above. We can use the following series of commands to
get there:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cd Desktop
$ cd shell-lesson-data
$ cd exercise-data</code></pre>
<p>These commands will move us from our home directory into our Desktop
directory, then into the <code>shell-lesson-data</code> directory, then
into the <code>exercise-data</code> directory. You will notice that
<code>cd</code> doesn’t print anything. This is normal. Many shell
commands will not output anything to the screen when successfully
executed. But if we run <code>pwd</code> after it, we can see that we
are now in
<code>/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data</code>.</p>
<p>If we run <code>ls -F</code> without arguments now, it lists the
contents of
<code>/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data</code>,
because that’s where we now are:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ pwd</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data</code></pre>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls -F</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>alkanes/  animal-counts/  creatures/  numbers.txt  writing/</code></pre>
<p>We now know how to go down the directory tree (i.e. how to go into a
subdirectory), but how do we go up (i.e. how do we leave a directory and
go into its parent directory)? We might try the following:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cd shell-lesson-data</code></pre>
<pre class="error"><code>-bash: cd: shell-lesson-data: No such file or directory</code></pre>
<p>But we get an error! Why is this?</p>
<p>With our methods so far, <code>cd</code> can only see sub-directories
inside your current directory. There are different ways to see
directories above your current location; we’ll start with the
simplest.</p>
<p>There is a shortcut in the shell to move up one directory level. It
works as follows:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cd ..</code></pre>
<p><code>..</code> is a special directory name meaning “the directory
containing this one”, or more succinctly, the <strong>parent</strong> of
the current directory. Sure enough, if we run <code>pwd</code> after
running <code>cd ..</code>, we’re back in
<code>/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data</code>:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ pwd</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data</code></pre>
<p>The special directory <code>..</code> doesn’t usually show up when we
run <code>ls</code>. If we want to display it, we can add the
<code>-a</code> option to <code>ls -F</code>:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls -F -a</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>./  ../  exercise-data/  north-pacific-gyre/</code></pre>
<p><code>-a</code> stands for ‘show all’ (including hidden files); it
forces <code>ls</code> to show us file and directory names that begin
with <code>.</code>, such as <code>..</code> (which, if we’re in
<code>/Users/nelle</code>, refers to the <code>/Users</code> directory).
As you can see, it also displays another special directory that’s just
called <code>.</code>, which means ‘the current working directory’. It
may seem redundant to have a name for it, but we’ll see some uses for it
soon.</p>
<p>Note that in most command line tools, multiple options can be
combined with a single <code>-</code> and no spaces between the options;
<code>ls -F -a</code> is equivalent to <code>ls -Fa</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="other-hidden-files" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Other Hidden Files</h2>
<p>In addition to the hidden directories <code>..</code> and
<code>.</code>, you may also see a file called
<code>.bash_profile</code>. This file usually contains shell
configuration settings. You may also see other files and directories
beginning with <code>.</code>. These are usually files and directories
that are used to configure different programs on your computer. The
prefix <code>.</code> is used to prevent these configuration files from
cluttering the terminal when a standard <code>ls</code> command is
used.</p>
</div>
<p>These three commands are the basic commands for navigating the
filesystem on your computer: <code>pwd</code>, <code>ls</code>, and
<code>cd</code>. Let’s explore some variations on those commands. What
happens if you type <code>cd</code> on its own, without giving a
directory?</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cd</code></pre>
<p>How can you check what happened? <code>pwd</code> gives us the
answer!</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ pwd</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>/Users/nelle</code></pre>
<p>It turns out that <code>cd</code> without an argument will return you
to your home directory, which is great if you’ve got lost in your own
filesystem.</p>
<p>Let’s try returning to the <code>exercise-data</code> directory from
before. Last time, we used three commands, but we can actually string
together the list of directories to move to <code>exercise-data</code>
in one step:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cd Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data</code></pre>
<p>Check that we’ve moved to the right place by running <code>pwd</code>
and <code>ls -F</code>.</p>
<p>If we want to move up one level from the data directory, we could use
<code>cd ..</code>. But there is another way to move to any directory,
regardless of your current location.</p>
<p>So far, when specifying directory names, or even a directory path (as
above), we have been using <strong>relative paths</strong>. When you use
a relative path with a command like <code>ls</code> or <code>cd</code>,
it tries to find that location from where we are, rather than from the
root of the file system.</p>
<p>However, it is possible to specify the <strong>absolute path</strong>
to a directory by including its entire path from the root directory,
which is indicated by a leading slash. The leading <code>/</code> tells
the computer to follow the path from the root of the file system, so it
always refers to exactly one directory, no matter where we are when we
run the command.</p>
<p>This allows us to move to our <code>shell-lesson-data</code>
directory from anywhere on the filesystem (including from inside
<code>exercise-data</code>). To find the absolute path we’re looking
for, we can use <code>pwd</code> and then extract the piece we need to
move to <code>shell-lesson-data</code>.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ pwd</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data</code></pre>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cd /Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data</code></pre>
<p>Run <code>pwd</code> and <code>ls -F</code> to ensure that we’re in
the directory we expect.</p>
<div id="two-more-shortcuts" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Two More Shortcuts</h2>
<p>The shell interprets a tilde (<code>~</code>) character at the start
of a path to mean “the current user’s home directory”. For example, if
Nelle’s home directory is <code>/Users/nelle</code>, then
<code>~/data</code> is equivalent to <code>/Users/nelle/data</code>.
This only works if it is the first character in the path;
<code>here/there/~/elsewhere</code> is <em>not</em>
<code>here/there/Users/nelle/elsewhere</code>.</p>
<p>Another shortcut is the <code>-</code> (dash) character.
<code>cd</code> will translate <code>-</code> into <em>the previous
directory I was in</em>, which is faster than having to remember, then
type, the full path. This is a <em>very</em> efficient way of moving
<em>back and forth between two directories</em> – i.e. if you execute
<code>cd -</code> twice, you end up back in the starting directory.</p>
<p>The difference between <code>cd ..</code> and <code>cd -</code> is
that the former brings you <em>up</em>, while the latter brings you
<em>back</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Try it! First navigate to <code>~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data</code>
(you should already be there).</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data</code></pre>
<p>Then <code>cd</code> into the <code>exercise-data/creatures</code>
directory</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cd exercise-data/creatures</code></pre>
<p>Now if you run</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cd -</code></pre>
<p>you’ll see you’re back in <code>~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data</code>.
Run <code>cd -</code> again and you’re back in
<code>~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/creatures</code></p>

<div id="general-syntax-of-a-shell-command" class="section level2">
<h2>General Syntax of a Shell Command</h2>
<p>We have now encountered commands, options, and arguments, but it is
perhaps useful to formalise some terminology.</p>
<p>Consider the command below as a general example of a command, which
we will dissect into its component parts:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls -F /</code></pre>
<p><img src="images/shell_command_syntax.svg"
alt="General syntax of a shell command" /></p>
<p><code>ls</code> is the <strong>command</strong>, with an
<strong>option</strong> <code>-F</code> and an <strong>argument</strong>
<code>/</code>. We’ve already encountered options which either start
with a single dash (<code>-</code>), known as <strong>short
options</strong>, or two dashes (<code>--</code>), known as <strong>long
options</strong>. [Options] change the behavior of a command and <a
href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/reference.html#argument">Arguments</a>
tell the command what to operate on (e.g. files and directories).
Sometimes options and arguments are referred to as
<strong>parameters</strong>. A command can be called with more than one
option and more than one argument, but a command doesn’t always require
an argument or an option.</p>
<p>You might sometimes see options being referred to as
<strong>switches</strong> or <strong>flags</strong>, especially for
options that take no argument. In this lesson we will stick with using
the term <em>option</em>.</p>
<p>Each part is separated by spaces. If you omit the space between
<code>ls</code> and <code>-F</code> the shell will look for a command
called <code>ls-F</code>, which doesn’t exist. Also, capitalization can
be important. For example, <code>ls -s</code> will display the size of
files and directories alongside the names, while <code>ls -S</code> will
sort the files and directories by size, as shown below:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data
$ ls -s exercise-data</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>total 28
 4 animal-counts   4 creatures  12 numbers.txt   4 alkanes   4 writing</code></pre>
<p>Note that the sizes returned by <code>ls -s</code> are in
<em>blocks</em>. As these are defined differently for different
operating systems, you may not obtain the same figures as in the
example.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls -S exercise-data</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>animal-counts  creatures  alkanes  writing  numbers.txt</code></pre>
<p>Putting all that together, our command <code>ls -F /</code> above
gives us a listing of files and directories in the root directory
<code>/</code>. An example of the output you might get from the above
command is given below:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls -F /</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Applications/         System/

<div id="nelles-pipeline-organizing-files" class="section level3">
<h3>Nelle’s Pipeline: Organizing Files</h3>
<p>Knowing this much about files and directories, Nelle is ready to
organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.</p>
<p>She creates a directory called <code>north-pacific-gyre</code> (to
remind herself where the data came from), which will contain the data
files from the assay machine and her data processing scripts.</p>
<p>Each of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab’s
convention with a unique ten-character ID, such as ‘NENE01729A’. This ID
is what she used in her collection log to record the location, time,
depth, and other characteristics of the sample, so she decides to use it
within the filename of each data file. Since the output of the assay
machine is plain text, she will call her files
<code>NENE01729A.txt</code>, <code>NENE01812A.txt</code>, and so on. All
1520 files will go into the same directory.</p>
<p>Now in her current directory <code>shell-lesson-data</code>, Nelle
can see what files she has using the command:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls north-pacific-gyre/</code></pre>
<p>This command is a lot to type, but she can let the shell do most of
the work through what is called <strong>tab completion</strong>. If she
types:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls nor</code></pre>
<p>and then presses <kbd>Tab</kbd> (the tab key on her keyboard), the
shell automatically completes the directory name for her:</p>

<h2>Creating directories</h2>
<p>We now know how to explore files and directories, but how do we
create them in the first place?</p>
<p>In this episode we will learn about creating and moving files and
directories, using the <code>exercise-data/writing</code> directory as
an example.</p>
<div id="step-one-see-where-we-are-and-what-we-already-have"
class="section level3">
<h3>Step one: see where we are and what we already have</h3>
<p>We should still be in the <code>shell-lesson-data</code> directory on
the Desktop, which we can check using:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ pwd</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data</code></pre>
<p>Next we’ll move to the <code>exercise-data/writing</code> directory
and see what it contains:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cd exercise-data/writing/
$ ls -F</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>haiku.txt  LittleWomen.txt</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="create-a-directory" class="section level3">
<h3>Create a directory</h3>
<p>Let’s create a new directory called <code>thesis</code> using the
command <code>mkdir thesis</code> (which has no output):</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ mkdir thesis</code></pre>
<p>As you might guess from its name, <code>mkdir</code> means ‘make
directory’. Since <code>thesis</code> is a relative path (i.e., does not
have a leading slash, like <code>/what/ever/thesis</code>), the new
directory is created in the current working directory:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls -F</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>haiku.txt  LittleWomen.txt  thesis/</code></pre>
<p>Since we’ve just created the <code>thesis</code> directory, there’s
nothing in it yet:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls -F thesis</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>mkdir</code> is not limited to creating single
directories one at a time. The <code>-p</code> option allows
<code>mkdir</code> to create a directory with nested subdirectories in a
single operation:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ mkdir -p ../project/data ../project/results</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-R</code> option to the <code>ls</code> command will list
all nested subdirectories within a directory. Let’s use
<code>ls -FR</code> to recursively list the new directory hierarchy we
just created in the <code>project</code> directory:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls -FR ../project</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>../project/:
data/  results/

../project/data:

../project/results:</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="two-ways-of-doing-the-same-thing"
class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Two ways of doing the same thing</h2>
<p>Using the shell to create a directory is no different than using a
file explorer. If you open the current directory using your operating
system’s graphical file explorer, the <code>thesis</code> directory will
appear there too. While the shell and the file explorer are two
different ways of interacting with the files, the files and directories
themselves are the same.</p>
</div>
<div id="good-names-for-files-and-directories"
class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Good names for files and directories</h2>
<p>Complicated names of files and directories can make your life painful
when working on the command line. Here we provide a few useful tips for
the names of your files and directories.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Don’t use spaces.</li>
</ol>
<p>Spaces can make a name more meaningful, but since spaces are used to
separate arguments on the command line it is better to avoid them in
names of files and directories. You can use <code>-</code> or
<code>_</code> instead (e.g. <code>north-pacific-gyre/</code> rather
than <code>north pacific gyre/</code>). To test this out, try typing
<code>mkdir north pacific gyre</code> and see what directory (or
directories!) are made when you check with <code>ls -F</code>.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Don’t begin the name with <code>-</code> (dash).</li>
</ol>
<p>Commands treat names starting with <code>-</code> as options.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Stick with letters, numbers, <code>.</code> (period or ‘full stop’),
<code>-</code> (dash) and <code>_</code> (underscore).</li>
</ol>
<p>Many other characters have special meanings on the command line. We
will learn about some of these during this lesson. There are special
characters that can cause your command to not work as expected and can
even result in data loss.</p>
<p>If you need to refer to names of files or directories that have
spaces or other special characters, you should surround the name in
quotes (<code>""</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="instructor">
<p>Learners can sometimes get trapped within command-line text editors
such as Vim, Emacs, or Nano. Closing the terminal emulator and opening a
new one can be frustrating as learners will have to navigate to the
correct folder again. Our recommendation to mitigate this problem is
that instructors should use the same text editor as the learners during
workshops (in most cases Nano).</p>
</div>
<div id="create-a-text-file" class="section level3">
<h3>Create a text file</h3>
<p>Let’s change our working directory to <code>thesis</code> using
<code>cd</code>, then run a text editor called Nano to create a file
called <code>draft.txt</code>:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cd thesis
$ nano draft.txt</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="which-editor" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Which Editor?</h2>
<p>When we say, ‘<code>nano</code> is a text editor’ we really do mean
‘text’. It can only work with plain character data, not tables, images,
or any other human-friendly media. We use it in examples because it is
one of the least complex text editors. However, because of this trait,
it may not be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need
to do after this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and macOS),
many programmers use <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> or <a
href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> (both of which require more time to
learn), or a graphical editor such as <a
href="https://projects.gnome.org/gedit/">Gedit</a> or <a
href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VScode</a>. On Windows, you may
wish to use <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>.
Windows also has a built-in editor called <code>notepad</code> that can
be run from the command line in the same way as <code>nano</code> for
the purposes of this lesson.</p>
<p>No matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it
searches for and saves files. If you start it from the shell, it will
(probably) use your current working directory as its default location.
If you use your computer’s start menu, it may want to save files in your
Desktop or Documents directory instead. You can change this by
navigating to another directory the first time you ‘Save As…’</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s type in a few lines of text.</p>
<p><img src="images/nano-screenshot.png"
alt="screenshot of nano text editor in action with the text It&#39;s not publish or perish any more, it&#39;s share and thrive" /></p>
<p>Once we’re happy with our text, we can press
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> (press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or
<kbd>Control</kbd> key and, while holding it down, press the
<kbd>O</kbd> key) to write our data to disk. We will be asked to provide
a name for the file that will contain our text. Press <kbd>Return</kbd>
to accept the suggested default of <code>draft.txt</code>.</p>
<p>Once our file is saved, we can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to
quit the editor and return to the shell.</p>
<div id="control-ctrl-or-key" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Control, Ctrl, or ^ Key</h2>
<p>The Control key is also called the ‘Ctrl’ key. There are various ways
in which using the Control key may be described. For example, you may
see an instruction to press the <kbd>Control</kbd> key and, while
holding it down, press the <kbd>X</kbd> key, described as any of:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Control-X</code></li>
<li><code>Control+X</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl-X</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl+X</code></li>
<li><code>^X</code></li>
<li><code>C-x</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In nano, along the bottom of the screen you’ll see
<code>^G Get Help ^O WriteOut</code>. This means that you can use
<code>Control-G</code> to get help and <code>Control-O</code> to save
your file.</p>
</div>
<p><code>nano</code> doesn’t leave any output on the screen after it
exits, but <code>ls</code> now shows that we have created a file called
<code>draft.txt</code>:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>draft.txt</code></pre>
<div class="challenge">
<div id="creating-files-a-different-way" class="section level2">
<h2>Creating Files a Different Way</h2>
<p>We have seen how to create text files using the <code>nano</code>
editor. Now, try the following command:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ touch my_file.txt</code></pre>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What did the <code>touch</code> command do? When you look at your
current directory using the GUI file explorer, does the file show
up?</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>ls -l</code> to inspect the files. How large is
<code>my_file.txt</code>?</p></li>
<li><p>When might you want to create a file this way?</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="solution-5" class="section level2 solution">
<h2>Solution</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The <code>touch</code> command generates a new file called
<code>my_file.txt</code> in your current directory. You can observe this
newly generated file by typing <code>ls</code> at the command line
prompt. <code>my_file.txt</code> can also be viewed in your GUI file
explorer.</p></li>
<li><p>When you inspect the file with <code>ls -l</code>, note that the
size of <code>my_file.txt</code> is 0 bytes. In other words, it contains
no data. If you open <code>my_file.txt</code> using your text editor it
is blank.</p></li>
<li><p>Some programs do not generate output files themselves, but
instead require that empty files have already been generated. When the
program is run, it searches for an existing file to populate with its
output. The touch command allows you to efficiently generate a blank
text file to be used by such programs.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>To avoid confusion later on, we suggest removing the file you’ve just
created before proceeding with the rest of the episode, otherwise future
outputs may vary from those given in the lesson. To do this, use the
following command:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ rm my_file.txt</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="whats-in-a-name" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>What’s In A Name?</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that all of Nelle’s files are named ‘something
dot something’, and in this part of the lesson, we always used the
extension <code>.txt</code>. This is just a convention; we can call a
file <code>mythesis</code> or almost anything else we want. However,
most people use two-part names most of the time to help them (and their
programs) tell different kinds of files apart. The second part of such a
name is called the <strong>filename extension</strong> and indicates
what type of data the file holds: <code>.txt</code> signals a plain text
file, <code>.pdf</code> indicates a PDF document, <code>.cfg</code> is a
configuration file full of parameters for some program or other,
<code>.png</code> is a PNG image, and so on.</p>
<p>This is just a convention, albeit an important one. Files merely
contain bytes; it’s up to us and our programs to interpret those bytes
according to the rules for plain text files, PDF documents,
configuration files, images, and so on.</p>
<p>Naming a PNG image of a whale as <code>whale.mp3</code> doesn’t
somehow magically turn it into a recording of whale song, though it
<em>might</em> cause the operating system to associate the file with a
music player program. In this case, if someone double-clicked
<code>whale.mp3</code> in a file explorer program,the music player will
automatically (and erroneously) attempt to open the
<code>whale.mp3</code> file.</p>
</div>
<div id="moving-files-and-directories" class="section level2">
<h2>Moving files and directories</h2>
<p>Returning to the <code>shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing</code>
directory,</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing</code></pre>
<p>In our <code>thesis</code> directory we have a file
<code>draft.txt</code> which isn’t a particularly informative name, so
let’s change the file’s name using <code>mv</code>, which is short for
‘move’:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt</code></pre>
<p>The first argument tells <code>mv</code> what we’re ‘moving’, while
the second is where it’s to go. In this case, we’re moving
<code>thesis/draft.txt</code> to <code>thesis/quotes.txt</code>, which
has the same effect as renaming the file. Sure enough, <code>ls</code>
shows us that <code>thesis</code> now contains one file called
<code>quotes.txt</code>:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls thesis</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>quotes.txt</code></pre>
<p>One must be careful when specifying the target file name, since
<code>mv</code> will silently overwrite any existing file with the same
name, which could lead to data loss. By default, <code>mv</code> will
not ask for confirmation before overwriting files. However, an
additional option, <code>mv -i</code> (or
<code>mv --interactive</code>), will cause <code>mv</code> to request
such confirmation.</p>
<p>Note that <code>mv</code> also works on directories.</p>
<p>Let’s move <code>quotes.txt</code> into the current working
directory. We use <code>mv</code> once again, but this time we’ll use
just the name of a directory as the second argument to tell
<code>mv</code> that we want to keep the filename but put the file
somewhere new. (This is why the command is called ‘move’.) In this case,
the directory name we use is the special directory name <code>.</code>
that we mentioned earlier.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ mv thesis/quotes.txt .</code></pre>
<p>The effect is to move the file from the directory it was in to the
current working directory. <code>ls</code> now shows us that
<code>thesis</code> is empty:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls thesis</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>$</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, we can confirm the file <code>quotes.txt</code> is no
longer present in the <code>thesis</code> directory by explicitly trying
to list it:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls thesis/quotes.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="error"><code>ls: cannot access &#39;thesis/quotes.txt&#39;: No such file or directory</code></pre>
<p><code>ls</code> with a filename or directory as an argument only
lists the requested file or directory. If the file given as the argument
doesn’t exist, the shell returns an error as we saw above. We can use
this to see that <code>quotes.txt</code> is now present in our current
directory:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls quotes.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>quotes.txt</code></pre>

<div id="copying-files-and-directories" class="section level2">
<h2>Copying files and directories</h2>
<p>The <code>cp</code> command works very much like <code>mv</code>,
except it copies a file instead of moving it. We can check that it did
the right thing using <code>ls</code> with two paths as arguments — like
most Unix commands, <code>ls</code> can be given multiple paths at
once:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
$ ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>quotes.txt   thesis/quotations.txt</code></pre>
<p>We can also copy a directory and all its contents by using the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">recursive</a> option
<code>-r</code>, e.g. to back up a directory:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cp -r thesis thesis_backup</code></pre>
<p>We can check the result by listing the contents of both the
<code>thesis</code> and <code>thesis_backup</code> directory:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls thesis thesis_backup</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>thesis:
quotations.txt

thesis_backup:
quotations.txt</code></pre>
<p>It is important to include the <code>-r</code> flag. If you want to
copy a directory and you omit this option you will see a message that
the directory has been omitted because
<code>-r not specified</code>.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cp thesis thesis_backup

Unix shell doesn’t have a trash bin, so all the files removed will

<h3>Using wildcards for accessing multiple files at once</h3>
</div>
<div id="wildcards" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Wildcards</h2>
<p><code>*</code> is a <strong>wildcard</strong>, which represents zero
or more other characters. Let’s consider the
<code>shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes</code> directory:
<code>*.pdb</code> represents <code>ethane.pdb</code>,
<code>propane.pdb</code>, and every file that ends with ‘.pdb’. On the
other hand, <code>p*.pdb</code> only represents <code>pentane.pdb</code>
and <code>propane.pdb</code>, because the ‘p’ at the front can only
represent filenames that begin with the letter ‘p’.</p>
<p><code>?</code> is also a wildcard, but it represents exactly one
character. So <code>?ethane.pdb</code> could represent
<code>methane.pdb</code> whereas <code>*ethane.pdb</code> represents
both <code>ethane.pdb</code> and <code>methane.pdb</code>.</p>
<p>Wildcards can be used in combination with each other. For example,
<code>???ane.pdb</code> indicates three characters followed by
<code>ane.pdb</code>, giving
<code>cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  octane.pdb</code>.</p>
<p>When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a
list of matching filenames <em>before</em> running the preceding
command. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match any
file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command as it
is. For example, typing <code>ls *.pdf</code> in the
<code>alkanes</code> directory (which contains only files with names
ending with <code>.pdb</code>) results in an error message that there is
no file called <code>*.pdf</code>. However, generally commands like
<code>wc</code> and <code>ls</code> see the lists of file names matching
these expressions, but not the wildcards themselves. It is the shell,
not the other programs, that expands the wildcards.</p>

<p><code>2.</code> shows all files whose names start with zero or more
characters (<code>*</code>) followed by the letter <code>t</code>, then
a single character (<code>?</code>), then <code>ne.</code> followed by
zero or more characters (<code>*</code>). This will give us
<code>octane.pdb</code> and <code>pentane.pdb</code> but doesn’t match
anything which ends in <code>thane.pdb</code>.</p>
<p><code>3.</code> fixes the problems of option 2 by matching two

<ul>
<li>How can I combine existing commands to do new things?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Now that we know a few basic commands, we can finally look at the
shell’s most powerful feature: the ease with which it lets us combine
existing programs in new ways. We’ll start with the directory
<code>shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes</code> that contains six
files describing some simple organic molecules. The <code>.pdb</code>
extension indicates that these files are in Protein Data Bank format, a
simple text format that specifies the type and position of each atom in
the molecule.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>cubane.pdb    methane.pdb    pentane.pdb
ethane.pdb    octane.pdb     propane.pdb</code></pre>
<p>Let’s run an example command:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ wc cubane.pdb</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>20  156 1158 cubane.pdb</code></pre>
<p><code>wc</code> is the ‘word count’ command: it counts the number of
lines, words, and characters in files (returning the values in that
order from left to right).</p>
<p>If we run the command <code>wc *.pdb</code>, the <code>*</code> in
<code>*.pdb</code> matches zero or more characters, so the shell turns
<code>*.pdb</code> into a list of all <code>.pdb</code> files in the
current directory:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ wc *.pdb</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>  20  156  1158  cubane.pdb
  12  84   622   ethane.pdb
   9  57   422   methane.pdb
  30  246  1828  octane.pdb
  21  165  1226  pentane.pdb
  15  111  825   propane.pdb
 107  819  6081  total</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>wc *.pdb</code> also shows the total number of all
lines in the last line of the output.</p>
<p>If we run <code>wc -l</code> instead of just <code>wc</code>, the
output shows only the number of lines per file:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ wc -l *.pdb</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>  20  cubane.pdb
  12  ethane.pdb
   9  methane.pdb
  30  octane.pdb
  21  pentane.pdb
  15  propane.pdb
 107  total</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-m</code> and <code>-w</code> options can also be used with
the <code>wc</code> command to show only the number of characters or the
number of words, respectively.</p>
<div id="why-isnt-it-doing-anything" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Why Isn’t It Doing Anything?</h2>
<p>What happens if a command is supposed to process a file, but we don’t
give it a filename? For example, what if we type:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ wc -l</code></pre>
<p>but don’t type <code>*.pdb</code> (or anything else) after the
command? Since it doesn’t have any filenames, <code>wc</code> assumes it
is supposed to process input given at the command prompt, so it just
sits there and waits for us to give it some data interactively. From the
outside, though, all we see is it sitting there, and the command doesn’t
appear to do anything.</p>
<p>If you make this kind of mistake, you can escape out of this state by
holding down the control key (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>) and pressing the letter
<kbd>C</kbd> once: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>. Then release both
keys.</p>
</div>
<div id="capturing-output-from-commands" class="section level2">
<h2>Capturing output from commands</h2>
<p>Which of these files contains the fewest lines? It’s an easy question
to answer when there are only six files, but what if there were 6000?
Our first step toward a solution is to run the command:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ wc -l *.pdb &gt; lengths.txt</code></pre>
<p>The greater than symbol, <code>&gt;</code>, tells the shell to
<strong>redirect</strong> the command’s output to a file instead of
printing it to the screen. This command prints no screen output, because
everything that <code>wc</code> would have printed has gone into the
file <code>lengths.txt</code> instead. If the file doesn’t exist prior
to issuing the command, the shell will create the file. If the file
exists already, it will be silently overwritten, which may lead to data
loss. Thus, <strong>redirect</strong> commands require caution.</p>
<p><code>ls lengths.txt</code> confirms that the file exists:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls lengths.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>lengths.txt</code></pre>
<p>We can now send the content of <code>lengths.txt</code> to the screen
using <code>cat lengths.txt</code>. The <code>cat</code> command gets
its name from ‘concatenate’ i.e. join together, and it prints the
contents of files one after another. There’s only one file in this case,
so <code>cat</code> just shows us what it contains:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cat lengths.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>  20  cubane.pdb
  12  ethane.pdb
   9  methane.pdb
  30  octane.pdb
  21  pentane.pdb
  15  propane.pdb
 107  total</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="output-page-by-page" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Output Page by Page</h2>
<p>We’ll continue to use <code>cat</code> in this lesson, for
convenience and consistency, but it has the disadvantage that it always
dumps the whole file onto your screen. More useful in practice is the
command <code>less</code> (e.g. <code>less lengths.txt</code>). This
displays a screenful of the file, and then stops. You can go forward one
screenful by pressing the spacebar, or back one by pressing
<code>b</code>. Press <code>q</code> to quit.</p>
</div>
<div id="filtering-output" class="section level2">
<h2>Filtering output</h2>
<p>Next we’ll use the <code>sort</code> command to sort the contents of
the <code>lengths.txt</code> file. But first we’ll do an exercise to
learn a little about the sort command:</p>
</div>
<div class="challenge">
<div id="what-does-sort--n-do" class="section level2">
<h2>What Does <code>sort -n</code> Do?</h2>

<p>If we run <code>sort</code> on this file, the output is:</p>
<pre class="output"><code>10

<p>If we run <code>sort -n</code> on the same file, we get this
instead:</p>
<pre class="output"><code>2
6
10
19
22</code></pre>
<p>Explain why <code>-n</code> has this effect.</p>
</div>
<div id="solution-15" class="section level2 solution">
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>The <code>-n</code> option specifies a numerical rather than an
alphanumerical sort.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We will also use the <code>-n</code> option to specify that the sort
is numerical instead of alphanumerical. This does <em>not</em> change
the file; instead, it sends the sorted result to the screen:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ sort -n lengths.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>  9  methane.pdb
 12  ethane.pdb
 15  propane.pdb
 20  cubane.pdb
 21  pentane.pdb
 30  octane.pdb
107  total</code></pre>
<p>We can put the sorted list of lines in another temporary file called
<code>sorted-lengths.txt</code> by putting
<code>&gt; sorted-lengths.txt</code> after the command, just as we used
<code>&gt; lengths.txt</code> to put the output of <code>wc</code> into
<code>lengths.txt</code>. Once we’ve done that, we can run another
command called <code>head</code> to get the first few lines in
<code>sorted-lengths.txt</code>:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ sort -n lengths.txt &gt; sorted-lengths.txt
$ head -n 1 sorted-lengths.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>  9  methane.pdb</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>-n 1</code> with <code>head</code> tells it that we only
want the first line of the file; <code>-n 20</code> would get the first
20, and so on. Since <code>sorted-lengths.txt</code> contains the
lengths of our files ordered from least to greatest, the output of
<code>head</code> must be the file with the fewest lines.</p>
<div id="redirecting-to-the-same-file" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Redirecting to the same file</h2>
<p>It’s a very bad idea to try redirecting the output of a command that
operates on a file to the same file. For example:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ sort -n lengths.txt &gt; lengths.txt</code></pre>
<p>Doing something like this may give you incorrect results and/or

operator also writes ‘hello’ to a file (in this case
<code>testfile02.txt</code>), but appends the string to the file if it

<p>Option 3 is correct. For option 1 to be correct we would only run the

the <code>tail</code> command. For option 4 to be correct we would have

<div id="passing-output-to-another-command" class="section level2">
<h2>Passing output to another command</h2>
<p>In our example of finding the file with the fewest lines, we are
using two intermediate files <code>lengths.txt</code> and
<code>sorted-lengths.txt</code> to store output. This is a confusing way
to work because even once you understand what <code>wc</code>,
<code>sort</code>, and <code>head</code> do, those intermediate files
make it hard to follow what’s going on. We can make it easier to
understand by running <code>sort</code> and <code>head</code>
together:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ sort -n lengths.txt | head -n 1</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>  9  methane.pdb</code></pre>
<p>The vertical bar, <code>|</code>, between the two commands is called
a <strong>pipe</strong>. It tells the shell that we want to use the
output of the command on the left as the input to the command on the
right.</p>
<p>This has removed the need for the <code>sorted-lengths.txt</code>
file.</p>
</div>
<div id="combining-multiple-commands" class="section level2">
<h2>Combining multiple commands</h2>
<p>Nothing prevents us from chaining pipes consecutively. We can for
example send the output of <code>wc</code> directly to
<code>sort</code>, and then send the resulting output to
<code>head</code>. This removes the need for any intermediate files.</p>
<p>We’ll start by using a pipe to send the output of <code>wc</code> to
<code>sort</code>:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>   9 methane.pdb
  12 ethane.pdb
  15 propane.pdb
  20 cubane.pdb
  21 pentane.pdb
  30 octane.pdb
 107 total</code></pre>
<p>We can then send that output through another pipe, to
<code>head</code>, so that the full pipeline becomes:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n | head -n 1</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>   9  methane.pdb</code></pre>
<p>This is exactly like a mathematician nesting functions like
<em>log(3x)</em> and saying ‘the log of three times <em>x</em>’. In our
case, the algorithm is ‘head of sort of line count of
<code>*.pdb</code>’.</p>

illustrated below:</p>

<h2>Tools designed to work together</h2>
<p>This idea of linking programs together is why Unix has been so
successful. Instead of creating enormous programs that try to do many
different things, Unix programmers focus on creating lots of simple
tools that each do one job well, and that work well with each other.
This programming model is called ‘pipes and filters’. We’ve already seen
pipes; a <strong>filter</strong> is a program like <code>wc</code> or
<code>sort</code> that transforms a stream of input into a stream of
output. Almost all of the standard Unix tools can work this way. Unless
told to do otherwise, they read from standard input, do something with
what they’ve read, and write to standard output.</p>
<p>The key is that any program that reads lines of text from standard
input and writes lines of text to standard output can be combined with
every other program that behaves this way as well. You can <em>and
should</em> write your programs this way so that you and other people
can put those programs into pipes to multiply their power.</p>

<h2>Nelle’s Pipeline: Checking Files</h2>
<p>Nelle has run her samples through the assay machines and created 17
files in the <code>north-pacific-gyre</code> directory described
earlier. As a quick check, starting from the
<code>shell-lesson-data</code> directory, Nelle types:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cd north-pacific-gyre
$ wc -l *.txt</code></pre>
<p>The output is 18 lines that look like this:</p>
<pre class="output"><code>300 NENE01729A.txt
300 NENE01729B.txt
300 NENE01736A.txt
300 NENE01751A.txt
300 NENE01751B.txt
300 NENE01812A.txt
... ...</code></pre>
<p>Now she types this:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ wc -l *.txt | sort -n | head -n 5</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code> 240 NENE02018B.txt
 300 NENE01729A.txt
 300 NENE01729B.txt
 300 NENE01736A.txt
 300 NENE01751A.txt</code></pre>
<p>Whoops: one of the files is 60 lines shorter than the others. When
she goes back and checks it, she sees that she did that assay at 8:00 on
a Monday morning — someone was probably in using the machine on the
weekend, and she forgot to reset it. Before re-running that sample, she
checks to see if any files have too much data:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ wc -l *.txt | sort -n | tail -n 5</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code> 300 NENE02040B.txt
 300 NENE02040Z.txt
 300 NENE02043A.txt
 300 NENE02043B.txt
5040 total</code></pre>
<p>Those numbers look good — but what’s that ‘Z’ doing there in the
third-to-last line? All of her samples should be marked ‘A’ or ‘B’; by
convention, her lab uses ‘Z’ to indicate samples with missing
information. To find others like it, she does this:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ls *Z.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>NENE01971Z.txt    NENE02040Z.txt</code></pre>
<p>Sure enough, when she checks the log on her laptop, there’s no depth
recorded for either of those samples. Since it’s too late to get the
information any other way, she must exclude those two files from her
analysis. She could delete them using <code>rm</code>, but there are
actually some analyses she might do later where depth doesn’t matter, so
instead, she’ll have to be careful later on to select files using the
wildcard expressions <code>NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Loops</strong> are a programming construct which allow us to
repeat a command or set of commands for each item in a list. As such
they are key to productivity improvements through automation. Similar to
wildcards and tab completion, using loops also reduces the amount of
typing required (and hence reduces the number of typing mistakes).</p>
<p>Suppose we have several hundred genome data files named
<code>basilisk.dat</code>, <code>minotaur.dat</code>, and
<code>unicorn.dat</code>. For this example, we’ll use the
<code>exercise-data/creatures</code> directory which only has three
example files, but the principles can be applied to many many more files
at once.</p>
<p>The structure of these files is the same: the common name,
classification, and updated date are presented on the first three lines,
with DNA sequences on the following lines. Let’s look at the files:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ head -n 5 basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat</code></pre>
<p>We would like to print out the classification for each species, which
is given on the second line of each file. For each file, we would need
to execute the command <code>head -n 2</code> and pipe this to
<code>tail -n 1</code>. We’ll use a loop to solve this problem, but
first let’s look at the general form of a loop, using the pseudo-code
below:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code># The word &quot;for&quot; indicates the start of a &quot;For-loop&quot; command
for thing in list_of_things 
#The word &quot;do&quot; indicates the start of job execution list
do 
    # Indentation within the loop is not required, but aids legibility
    operation_using/command $thing 
# The word &quot;done&quot; indicates the end of a loop
done  </code></pre>
<p>and we can apply this to our example like this:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ for filename in basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat
&gt; do
&gt;     echo $filename
&gt;     head -n 2 $filename | tail -n 1
&gt; done</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>basilisk.dat
CLASSIFICATION: basiliscus vulgaris
minotaur.dat
CLASSIFICATION: bos hominus
unicorn.dat
CLASSIFICATION: equus monoceros</code></pre>
<div id="follow-the-prompt" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Follow the Prompt</h2>
<p>The shell prompt changes from <code>$</code> to <code>&gt;</code> and
back again as we were typing in our loop. The second prompt,
<code>&gt;</code>, is different to remind us that we haven’t finished
typing a complete command yet. A semicolon, <code>;</code>, can be used
to separate two commands written on a single line.</p>
</div>
<p>When the shell sees the keyword <code>for</code>, it knows to repeat
a command (or group of commands) once for each item in a list. Each time
the loop runs (called an iteration), an item in the list is assigned in
sequence to the <strong>variable</strong>, and the commands inside the
loop are executed, before moving on to the next item in the list. Inside
the loop, we call for the variable’s value by putting <code>$</code> in
front of it. The <code>$</code> tells the shell interpreter to treat the
variable as a variable name and substitute its value in its place,
rather than treat it as text or an external command.</p>
<p>In this example, the list is three filenames:
<code>basilisk.dat</code>, <code>minotaur.dat</code>, and
<code>unicorn.dat</code>. Each time the loop iterates, we first use
<code>echo</code> to print the value that the variable
<code>$filename</code> currently holds. This is not necessary for the
result, but beneficial for us here to have an easier time to follow
along. Next, we will assign a file name to the variable
<code>filename</code> and run the <code>head</code> command. The first
time through the loop, <code>$filename</code> is
<code>basilisk.dat</code>. The interpreter runs the command
<code>head</code> on <code>basilisk.dat</code> and pipes the first two
lines to the <code>tail</code> command, which then prints the second
line of <code>basilisk.dat</code>. For the second iteration,
<code>$filename</code> becomes <code>minotaur.dat</code>. This time, the
shell runs <code>head</code> on <code>minotaur.dat</code> and pipes the
first two lines to the <code>tail</code> command, which then prints the
second line of <code>minotaur.dat</code>. For the third iteration,
<code>$filename</code> becomes <code>unicorn.dat</code>, so the shell
runs the <code>head</code> command on that file, and <code>tail</code>
on the output of that. Since the list was only three items, the shell
exits the <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<div id="same-symbols-different-meanings"
class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Same Symbols, Different Meanings</h2>
<p>Here we see <code>&gt;</code> being used as a shell prompt, whereas
<code>&gt;</code> is also used to redirect output. Similarly,
<code>$</code> is used as a shell prompt, but, as we saw earlier, it is
also used to ask the shell to get the value of a variable.</p>
<p>If the <em>shell</em> prints <code>&gt;</code> or <code>$</code> then
it expects you to type something, and the symbol is a prompt.</p>
<p>If <em>you</em> type <code>&gt;</code> or <code>$</code> yourself, it
is an instruction from you that the shell should redirect output or get
the value of a variable.</p>
</div>
<p>When using variables it is also possible to put the names into curly
braces to clearly delimit the variable name: <code>$filename</code> is
equivalent to <code>${filename}</code>, but is different from
<code>${file}name</code>. You may find this notation in other people’s
programs.</p>
<p>We have called the variable in this loop <code>filename</code> in
order to make its purpose clearer to human readers. The shell itself
doesn’t care what the variable is called; if we wrote this loop as:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ for x in basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat
&gt; do
&gt;     head -n 2 $x | tail -n 1
&gt; done</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ for temperature in basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat
&gt; do
&gt;     head -n 2 $temperature | tail -n 1
&gt; done</code></pre>
<p>it would work exactly the same way. <em>Don’t do this.</em> Programs
are only useful if people can understand them, so meaningless names
(like <code>x</code>) or misleading names (like
<code>temperature</code>) increase the odds that the program won’t do
what its readers think it does.</p>
<p>In the above examples, the variables (<code>thing</code>,
<code>filename</code>, <code>x</code> and <code>temperature</code>)
could have been given any other name, as long as it is meaningful to
both the person writing the code and the person reading it.</p>
<p>Note also that loops can be used for other things than filenames,
like a list of numbers or a subset of data.</p>

<div id="solution-28" class="section level2 solution">
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>3 is the correct answer. <code>&gt;&gt;</code> appends to a file,
rather than overwriting it with the redirected output from a command.
Given the output from the <code>cat</code> command has been redirected,
nothing is printed to the screen.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let’s continue with our example in the
<code>shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/creatures</code> directory. Here’s
a slightly more complicated loop:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ for filename in *.dat
&gt; do
&gt;     echo $filename
&gt;     head -n 100 $filename | tail -n 20
&gt; done</code></pre>
<p>The shell starts by expanding <code>*.dat</code> to create the list
of files it will process. The <strong>loop body</strong> then executes
two commands for each of those files. The first command,
<code>echo</code>, prints its command-line arguments to standard output.
For example:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ echo hello there</code></pre>
<p>prints:</p>
<pre class="output"><code>hello there</code></pre>
<p>In this case, since the shell expands <code>$filename</code> to be
the name of a file, <code>echo $filename</code> prints the name of the
file. Note that we can’t write this as:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ for filename in *.dat
&gt; do
&gt;     $filename
&gt;     head -n 100 $filename | tail -n 20
&gt; done</code></pre>
<p>because then the first time through the loop, when
<code>$filename</code> expanded to <code>basilisk.dat</code>, the shell
would try to run <code>basilisk.dat</code> as a program. Finally, the
<code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> combination selects lines 81-100
from whatever file is being processed (assuming the file has at least
100 lines).</p>
<div id="spaces-in-names" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Spaces in Names</h2>
<p>Spaces are used to separate the elements of the list that we are
going to loop over. If one of those elements contains a space character,
we need to surround it with quotes, and do the same thing to our loop
variable. Suppose our data files are named:</p>
<pre class="source"><code>red dragon.dat
purple unicorn.dat</code></pre>
<p>To loop over these files, we would need to add double quotes like
so:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ for filename in &quot;red dragon.dat&quot; &quot;purple unicorn.dat&quot;
&gt; do
&gt;     head -n 100 &quot;$filename&quot; | tail -n 20
&gt; done</code></pre>
<p>It is simpler to avoid using spaces (or other special characters) in
filenames.</p>
<p>The files above don’t exist, so if we run the above code, the
<code>head</code> command will be unable to find them; however, the
error message returned will show the name of the files it is
expecting:</p>
<pre class="error"><code>head: cannot open âred dragon.dat&#39; for reading: No such file or directory
head: cannot open âpurple unicorn.dat&#39; for reading: No such file or directory</code></pre>
<p>Try removing the quotes around <code>$filename</code> in the loop
above to see the effect of the quote marks on spaces. Note that we get a
result from the loop command for unicorn.dat when we run this code in
the <code>creatures</code> directory:</p>
<pre class="output"><code>head: cannot open âred&#39; for reading: No such file or directory
head: cannot open âdragon.dat&#39; for reading: No such file or directory
head: cannot open âpurple&#39; for reading: No such file or directory
CGGTACCGAA
AAGGGTCGCG
CAAGTGTTCC
...</code></pre>
</div>
<p>We would like to modify each of the files in
<code>shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/creatures</code>, but also save a
version of the original files. We want to copy the original files to new
files named <code>original-basilisk.dat</code> and
<code>original-unicorn.dat</code>, for example. We can’t use:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cp *.dat original-*.dat</code></pre>
<p>because that would expand to:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cp basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat original-*.dat</code></pre>
<p>This wouldn’t back up our files, instead we get an error:</p>
<pre class="error"><code>cp: target `original-*.dat&#39; is not a directory</code></pre>
<p>This problem arises when <code>cp</code> receives more than two
inputs. When this happens, it expects the last input to be a directory
where it can copy all the files it was passed. Since there is no
directory named <code>original-*.dat</code> in the
<code>creatures</code> directory, we get an error.</p>
<p>Instead, we can use a loop:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ for filename in *.dat
&gt; do
&gt;     cp $filename original-$filename
&gt; done</code></pre>
<p>This loop runs the <code>cp</code> command once for each filename.
The first time, when <code>$filename</code> expands to
<code>basilisk.dat</code>, the shell executes:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>cp basilisk.dat original-basilisk.dat</code></pre>
<p>The second time, the command is:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>cp minotaur.dat original-minotaur.dat</code></pre>
<p>The third and last time, the command is:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>cp unicorn.dat original-unicorn.dat</code></pre>
<p>Since the <code>cp</code> command does not normally produce any
output, it’s hard to check that the loop is working correctly. However,
we learned earlier how to print strings using <code>echo</code>, and we
can modify the loop to use <code>echo</code> to print our commands
without actually executing them. As such we can check what commands
<em>would be</em> run in the unmodified loop.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows what happens when the modified loop is
executed and demonstrates how the judicious use of <code>echo</code> is
a good debugging technique.</p>
<p><img src="images/shell_script_for_loop_flow_chart.svg"
alt="The for loop &quot;for filename in .dat; do echo cp $filename original-$filename;done&quot; will successively assign the names of all &quot;.dat&quot; files in your currentdirectory to the variable &quot;$filename&quot; and then execute the command.

<div id="nelles-pipeline-processing-files" class="section level2">
<h2>Nelle’s Pipeline: Processing Files</h2>
<p>Nelle is now ready to process her data files using
<code>goostats.sh</code> — a shell script written by her supervisor.
This calculates some statistics from a protein sample file and takes two
arguments:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>an input file (containing the raw data)</li>
<li>an output file (to store the calculated statistics)</li>
</ol>
<p>Since she’s still learning how to use the shell, she decides to build
up the required commands in stages. Her first step is to make sure that
she can select the right input files — remember, these are ones whose
names end in ‘A’ or ‘B’, rather than ‘Z’. Moving to the
<code>north-pacific-gyre</code> directory, Nelle types:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cd
$ cd Desktop/shell-lesson-data/north-pacific-gyre
$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt
&gt; do
&gt;     echo $datafile
&gt; done</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>NENE01729A.txt
NENE01729B.txt
NENE01736A.txt
...
NENE02043A.txt
NENE02043B.txt</code></pre>
<p>Her next step is to decide what to call the files that the
<code>goostats.sh</code> analysis program will create. Prefixing each
input file’s name with ‘stats’ seems simple, so she modifies her loop to
do that:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt
&gt; do
&gt;     echo $datafile stats-$datafile
&gt; done</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt
NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
NENE01736A.txt stats-NENE01736A.txt
...
NENE02043A.txt stats-NENE02043A.txt
NENE02043B.txt stats-NENE02043B.txt</code></pre>
<p>She hasn’t actually run <code>goostats.sh</code> yet, but now she’s
sure she can select the right files and generate the right output
filenames.</p>
<p>Typing in commands over and over again is becoming tedious, though,
and Nelle is worried about making mistakes, so instead of re-entering
her loop, she presses <kbd>â’</kbd>. In response, the shell redisplays
the whole loop on one line (using semi-colons to separate the
pieces):</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do echo $datafile stats-$datafile; done</code></pre>
<p>Using the <kbd>â</kbd>, Nelle navigates to the <code>echo</code>
command and changes it to <code>bash goostats.sh</code>:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile; done</code></pre>
<p>When she presses <kbd>Enter</kbd>, the shell runs the modified
command. However, nothing appears to happen — there is no output. After
a moment, Nelle realizes that since her script doesn’t print anything to
the screen any longer, she has no idea whether it is running, much less
how quickly. She kills the running command by typing
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, uses <kbd>â’</kbd> to repeat the command,
and edits it to read:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do echo $datafile;
bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile; done</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="beginning-and-end" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Beginning and End</h2>
<p>We can move to the beginning of a line in the shell by typing
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> and to the end using
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>.</p>
</div>
<p>When she runs her program now, it produces one line of output every
five seconds or so:</p>
<pre class="output"><code>NENE01729A.txt
NENE01729B.txt
NENE01736A.txt
...</code></pre>
<p>1518 times 5 seconds, divided by 60, tells her that her script will
take about two hours to run. As a final check, she opens another
terminal window, goes into <code>north-pacific-gyre</code>, and uses
<code>cat stats-NENE01729B.txt</code> to examine one of the output
files. It looks good, so she decides to get some coffee and catch up on
her reading.</p>
<div id="those-who-know-history-can-choose-to-repeat-it"
class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Those Who Know History Can Choose to Repeat It</h2>
<p>Another way to repeat previous work is to use the
<code>history</code> command to get a list of the last few hundred
commands that have been executed, and then to use <code>!123</code>
(where ‘123’ is replaced by the command number) to repeat one of those
commands. For example, if Nelle types this:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ history | tail -n 5</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>456  for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do   echo $datafile stats-$datafile; done
457  for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do echo $datafile stats-$datafile; done
458  for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile; done
459  for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do echo $datafile; bash goostats.sh $datafile
stats-$datafile; done
460  history | tail -n 5</code></pre>
<p>then she can re-run <code>goostats.sh</code> on the files simply by
typing <code>!459</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="other-history-commands" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Other History Commands</h2>
<p>There are a number of other shortcut commands for getting at the

<ul>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> enters a history search mode

that matches the text you enter next. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>
one or more additional times to search for earlier matches. You can then
use the left and right arrow keys to choose that line and edit it then
hit <kbd>Return</kbd> to run the command.</li>
<li><code>!!</code> retrieves the immediately preceding command (you may
or may not find this more convenient than using <kbd>â’</kbd>)</li>
<li><code>!$</code> retrieves the last word of the last command. That’s
useful more often than you might expect: after
<code>bash goostats.sh NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt</code>, you
can type <code>less !$</code> to look at the file
<code>stats-NENE01729B.txt</code>, which is quicker than doing

<h2>Doing a Dry Run</h2>
<p>A loop is a way to do many things at once — or to make many mistakes

<em>would</em> do is to <code>echo</code> the commands it would run
instead of actually running them.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to preview the commands the following loop will
execute without actually running those commands:</p>

<p>The second version is the one we want to run. This prints to screen

<ul>
<li>How can I save and re-use commands?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>We are finally ready to see what makes the shell such a powerful
programming environment. We are going to take the commands we repeat
frequently and save them in files so that we can re-run all those
operations again later by typing a single command. For historical
reasons, a bunch of commands saved in a file is usually called a
<strong>shell script</strong>, but make no mistake — these are actually
small programs.</p>
<p>Not only will writing shell scripts make your work faster, but also
you won’t have to retype the same commands over and over again. It will
also make it more accurate (fewer chances for typos) and more
reproducible. If you come back to your work later (or if someone else
finds your work and wants to build on it), you will be able to reproduce
the same results simply by running your script, rather than having to
remember or retype a long list of commands.</p>
<p>Let’s start by going back to <code>alkanes/</code> and creating a new
file, <code>middle.sh</code> which will become our shell script:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cd alkanes
$ nano middle.sh</code></pre>
<p>The command <code>nano middle.sh</code> opens the file
<code>middle.sh</code> within the text editor ‘nano’ (which runs within
the shell). If the file does not exist, it will be created. We can use
the text editor to directly edit the file by inserting the following
line:</p>
<pre class="source"><code>head -n 15 octane.pdb | tail -n 5</code></pre>
<p>This is a variation on the pipe we constructed earlier, which selects
lines 11-15 of the file <code>octane.pdb</code>. Remember, we are
<em>not</em> running it as a command just yet; we are only incorporating
the commands in a file.</p>
<p>Then we save the file (<code>Ctrl-O</code> in nano) and exit the text
editor (<code>Ctrl-X</code> in nano). Check that the directory
<code>alkanes</code> now contains a file called
<code>middle.sh</code>.</p>
<p>Once we have saved the file, we can ask the shell to execute the
commands it contains. Our shell is called <code>bash</code>, so we run
the following command:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ bash middle.sh</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>ATOM      9  H           1      -4.502   0.681   0.785  1.00  0.00

<p>Sure enough, our script’s output is exactly what we would get if we
ran that pipeline directly.</p>
<div id="text-vs.-whatever" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Text vs. Whatever</h2>
<p>We usually call programs like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer
“text editors”, but we need to be a bit more careful when it comes to
programming. By default, Microsoft Word uses <code>.docx</code> files to
store not only text, but also formatting information about fonts,
headings, and so on. This extra information isn’t stored as characters
and doesn’t mean anything to tools like <code>head</code>, which expects
input files to contain nothing but the letters, digits, and punctuation
on a standard computer keyboard. When editing programs, therefore, you
must either use a plain text editor or be careful to save files as plain
text.</p>
</div>
<p>What if we want to select lines from an arbitrary file? We could edit
<code>middle.sh</code> each time to change the filename, but that would
probably take longer than typing the command out again in the shell and
executing it with a new file name. Instead, let’s edit
<code>middle.sh</code> and make it more versatile:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ nano middle.sh</code></pre>
<p>Now, within “nano”, replace the text <code>octane.pdb</code> with the
special variable called <code>$1</code>:</p>
<pre class="source"><code>head -n 15 &quot;$1&quot; | tail -n 5</code></pre>
<p>Inside a shell script, <code>$1</code> means ‘the first filename (or
other argument) on the command line’. We can now run our script like
this:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ bash middle.sh octane.pdb</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>ATOM      9  H           1      -4.502   0.681   0.785  1.00  0.00

<h2>Double-Quotes Around Arguments</h2>
<p>For the same reason that we put the loop variable inside
double-quotes, in case the filename happens to contain any spaces, we
surround <code>$1</code> with double-quotes.</p>
</div>
<p>Currently, we need to edit <code>middle.sh</code> each time we want
to adjust the range of lines that is returned. Let’s fix that by
configuring our script to instead use three command-line arguments.
After the first command-line argument (<code>$1</code>), each additional
argument that we provide will be accessible via the special variables
<code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, <code>$3</code>, which refer to the
first, second, third command-line arguments, respectively.</p>
<p>Knowing this, we can use additional arguments to define the range of
lines to be passed to <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code>
respectively:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ nano middle.sh</code></pre>
<pre class="source"><code>head -n &quot;$2&quot; &quot;$1&quot; | tail -n &quot;$3&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We can now run:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ bash middle.sh pentane.pdb 15 5</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>ATOM      9  H           1       1.324   0.350  -1.332  1.00  0.00
ATOM     10  H           1       1.271   1.378   0.122  1.00  0.00
ATOM     11  H           1      -0.074  -0.384   1.288  1.00  0.00
ATOM     12  H           1      -0.048  -1.362  -0.205  1.00  0.00
ATOM     13  H           1      -1.183   0.500  -1.412  1.00  0.00</code></pre>
<p>By changing the arguments to our command, we can change our script’s
behaviour:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ bash middle.sh pentane.pdb 20 5</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>ATOM     14  H           1      -1.259   1.420   0.112  1.00  0.00

TER      18              1</code></pre>
<p>This works, but it may take the next person who reads
<code>middle.sh</code> a moment to figure out what it does. We can
improve our script by adding some <strong>comments</strong> at the
top:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ nano middle.sh</code></pre>
<pre class="source"><code># Select lines from the middle of a file.
# Usage: bash middle.sh filename end_line num_lines
head -n &quot;$2&quot; &quot;$1&quot; | tail -n &quot;$3&quot;</code></pre>
<p>A comment starts with a <code>#</code> character and runs to the end
of the line. The computer ignores comments, but they’re invaluable for
helping people (including your future self) understand and use scripts.
The only caveat is that each time you modify the script, you should
check that the comment is still accurate. An explanation that sends the
reader in the wrong direction is worse than none at all.</p>
<p>What if we want to process many files in a single pipeline? For
example, if we want to sort our <code>.pdb</code> files by length, we
would type:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n</code></pre>
<p>because <code>wc -l</code> lists the number of lines in the files
(recall that <code>wc</code> stands for ‘word count’, adding the
<code>-l</code> option means ‘count lines’ instead) and
<code>sort -n</code> sorts things numerically. We could put this in a
file, but then it would only ever sort a list of <code>.pdb</code> files
in the current directory. If we want to be able to get a sorted list of
other kinds of files, we need a way to get all those names into the
script. We can’t use <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, and so on because
we don’t know how many files there are. Instead, we use the special
variable <code>$@</code>, which means, ‘All of the command-line
arguments to the shell script’. We also should put <code>$@</code>
inside double-quotes to handle the case of arguments containing spaces
(<code>"$@"</code> is special syntax and is equivalent to
<code>"$1"</code> <code>"$2"</code> …).</p>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ nano sorted.sh</code></pre>
<pre class="source"><code># Sort files by their length.
# Usage: bash sorted.sh one_or_more_filenames
wc -l &quot;$@&quot; | sort -n</code></pre>

<p>If you run the command:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ history | tail -n 5 &gt; recent.sh</code></pre>
<p>the last command in the file is the <code>history</code> command
itself, i.e., the shell has added <code>history</code> to the command

commands to the log before running them. Why do you think it does
this?</p>

<p>In practice, most people develop shell scripts by running commands at
the shell prompt a few times to make sure they’re doing the right thing,
then saving them in a file for re-use. This style of work allows people

one call to <code>history</code> and a bit of editing to clean up the

<h2>Nelle’s Pipeline: Creating a Script</h2>
<p>Nelle’s supervisor insisted that all her analytics must be
reproducible. The easiest way to capture all the steps is in a
script.</p>
<p>First we return to Nelle’s project directory:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cd ../../north-pacific-gyre/</code></pre>
<p>She creates a file using <code>nano</code> …</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ nano do-stats.sh</code></pre>
<p>…which contains the following:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code># Calculate stats for data files.
for datafile in &quot;$@&quot;
do
    echo $datafile
    bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile
done</code></pre>
<p>She saves this in a file called <code>do-stats.sh</code> so that she
can now re-do the first stage of her analysis by typing:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ bash do-stats.sh NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt</code></pre>
<p>She can also do this:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ bash do-stats.sh NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt | wc -l</code></pre>
<p>so that the output is just the number of files processed rather than
the names of the files that were processed.</p>
<p>One thing to note about Nelle’s script is that it lets the person
running it decide what files to process. She could have written it
as:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code># Calculate stats for Site A and Site B data files.
for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt
do
    echo $datafile
    bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile
done</code></pre>
<p>The advantage is that this always selects the right files: she
doesn’t have to remember to exclude the ‘Z’ files. The disadvantage is
that it <em>always</em> selects just those files — she can’t run it on
all files (including the ‘Z’ files), or on the ‘G’ or ‘H’ files her
colleagues in Antarctica are producing, without editing the script. If
she wanted to be more adventurous, she could modify her script to check
for command-line arguments, and use <code>NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt</code>
if none were provided. Of course, this introduces another tradeoff
between flexibility and complexity.</p>

<p>In the same way that many of us now use ‘Google’ as a verb meaning

contraction of ‘global/regular expression/print’, a common sequence of
operations in early Unix text editors. It is also the name of a very
useful command-line program.</p>
<p><code>grep</code> finds and prints lines in files that match a
pattern. For our examples, we will use a file that contains three haiku
taken from a <a

writing subdirectory:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cd
$ cd Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing
$ cat haiku.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>The Tao that is seen
Is not the true Tao, until
You bring fresh toner.

With searching comes loss
and the presence of absence:
&quot;My Thesis&quot; not found.

Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working
Software is like that.</code></pre>
<p>Let’s find lines that contain the word ‘not’:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ grep not haiku.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Is not the true Tao, until
&quot;My Thesis&quot; not found
Today it is not working</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>not</code> is the pattern we’re searching for. The grep
command searches through the file, looking for matches to the pattern
specified. To use it type <code>grep</code>, then the pattern we’re
searching for and finally the name of the file (or files) we’re
searching in.</p>
<p>The output is the three lines in the file that contain the letters
‘not’.</p>
<p>By default, grep searches for a pattern in a case-sensitive way. In
addition, the search pattern we have selected does not have to form a
complete word, as we will see in the next example.</p>
<p>Let’s search for the pattern: ‘The’.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ grep The haiku.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>The Tao that is seen
&quot;My Thesis&quot; not found.</code></pre>
<p>This time, two lines that include the letters ‘The’ are outputted,
one of which contained our search pattern within a larger word,
‘Thesis’.</p>
<p>To restrict matches to lines containing the word ‘The’ on its own, we
can give <code>grep</code> the <code>-w</code> option. This will limit
matches to word boundaries.</p>
<p>Later in this lesson, we will also see how we can change the search
behavior of grep with respect to its case sensitivity.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ grep -w The haiku.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>The Tao that is seen</code></pre>
<p>Note that a ‘word boundary’ includes the start and end of a line, so
not just letters surrounded by spaces. Sometimes we don’t want to search
for a single word, but a phrase. We can also do this with
<code>grep</code> by putting the phrase in quotes.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ grep -w &quot;is not&quot; haiku.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Today it is not working</code></pre>
<p>We’ve now seen that you don’t have to have quotes around single
words, but it is useful to use quotes when searching for multiple words.
It also helps to make it easier to distinguish between the search term
or phrase and the file being searched. We will use quotes in the
remaining examples.</p>
<p>Another useful option is <code>-n</code>, which numbers the lines
that match:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ grep -n &quot;it&quot; haiku.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>5:With searching comes loss
9:Yesterday it worked
10:Today it is not working</code></pre>
<p>Here, we can see that lines 5, 9, and 10 contain the letters
‘it’.</p>
<p>We can combine options (i.e. flags) as we do with other Unix
commands. For example, let’s find the lines that contain the word ‘the’.
We can combine the option <code>-w</code> to find the lines that contain
the word ‘the’ and <code>-n</code> to number the lines that match:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ grep -n -w &quot;the&quot; haiku.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>2:Is not the true Tao, until
6:and the presence of absence:</code></pre>
<p>Now we want to use the option <code>-i</code> to make our search
case-insensitive:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ grep -n -w -i &quot;the&quot; haiku.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>1:The Tao that is seen
2:Is not the true Tao, until
6:and the presence of absence:</code></pre>
<p>Now, we want to use the option <code>-v</code> to invert our search,
i.e., we want to output the lines that do not contain the word
‘the’.</p>

<div id="wildcards-1" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Wildcards</h2>
<p><code>grep</code>‘s real power doesn’t come from its options, though;
it comes from the fact that patterns can include wildcards. (The
technical name for these is <strong>regular expressions</strong>, which
is what the ’re’ in ‘grep’ stands for.) Regular expressions are both
complex and powerful; if you want to do complex searches, please look at
the lesson on <a
href="https://v4.software-carpentry.org/regexp/index.html">our
website</a>. As a taster, we can find lines that have an ‘o’ in the
second position like this:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ grep -E &quot;^.o&quot; haiku.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>You bring fresh toner.
Today it is not working
Software is like that.</code></pre>
<p>We use the <code>-E</code> option and put the pattern in quotes to
prevent the shell from trying to interpret it. (If the pattern contained
a <code>*</code>, for example, the shell would try to expand it before
running <code>grep</code>.) The <code>^</code> in the pattern anchors
the match to the start of the line. The <code>.</code> matches a single
character (just like <code>?</code> in the shell), while the
<code>o</code> matches an actual ‘o’.</p>

<h2>Tracking a Species</h2>
<p>Leah has several hundred data files saved in one directory, each of
which is formatted like this:</p>
<pre class="source"><code>2012-11-05,deer,5
2012-11-05,rabbit,22
2012-11-05,raccoon,7

2012-11-06,fox,4
2012-11-07,rabbit,16
2012-11-07,bear,1</code></pre>
<p>She wants to write a shell script that takes a species as the first
command-line argument and a directory as the second argument. The script
should return one file called <code>&lt;species&gt;.txt</code>
containing a list of dates and the number of that species seen on each
date. For example using the data shown above, <code>rabbit.txt</code>
would contain:</p>
<pre class="source"><code>2012-11-05,22
2012-11-06,19
2012-11-07,16</code></pre>
<p>Below, each line contains an individual command, or pipe. Arrange
their sequence in one command in order to achieve Leah’s goal:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>cut -d : -f 2
&gt;
|
grep -w $1 -r $2
|
$1.txt
cut -d , -f 1,3</code></pre>
<p>Hint: use <code>man grep</code> to look for how to grep text
recursively in a directory and <code>man cut</code> to select more than
one field in a line.</p>
<p>An example of such a file is provided in
<code>shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/animal-counts/animals.csv</code></p>

works. At the command line, try changing the order of the cut commands,
and have a look at the output from each step to see why this is the

<h2>Little Women</h2>
<p>You and your friend, having just finished reading <em>Little
Women</em> by Louisa May Alcott, are in an argument. Of the four sisters
in the book, Jo, Meg, Beth, and Amy, your friend thinks that Jo was the
most mentioned. You, however, are certain it was Amy. Luckily, you have
a file <code>LittleWomen.txt</code> containing the full text of the
novel
(<code>shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing/LittleWomen.txt</code>).
Using a <code>for</code> loop, how would you tabulate the number of
times each of the four sisters is mentioned?</p>
<p>Hint: one solution might employ the commands <code>grep</code> and
<code>wc</code> and a <code>|</code>, while another might utilize
<code>grep</code> options. There is often more than one way to solve a
programming task, so a particular solution is usually chosen based on a
combination of yielding the correct result, elegance, readability, and
speed.</p>
</div>
<div id="solutions-1" class="section level2 solution">
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<pre class="source"><code>for sis in Jo Meg Beth Amy
do
    echo $sis:
    grep -ow $sis LittleWomen.txt | wc -l
done</code></pre>
<p>Alternative, slightly inferior solution:</p>
<pre class="source"><code>for sis in Jo Meg Beth Amy
do
    echo $sis:
    grep -ocw $sis LittleWomen.txt
done</code></pre>
<p>This solution is inferior because <code>grep -c</code> only reports
the number of lines matched. The total number of matches reported by
this method will be lower if there is more than one match per line.</p>
<p>Perceptive observers may have noticed that character names sometimes
appear in all-uppercase in chapter titles (e.g. ‘MEG GOES TO VANITY
FAIR’). If you wanted to count these as well, you could add the
<code>-i</code> option for case-insensitivity (though in this case, it
doesn’t affect the answer to which sister is mentioned most
frequently).</p>

<p>While <code>grep</code> finds lines in files, the <code>find</code>

<p>The <code>exercise-data</code> directory contains one file,
<code>numbers.txt</code> and four directories:
<code>animal-counts</code>, <code>creatures</code>, <code>alkanes</code>
and <code>writing</code> containing various files.</p>
<p>For our first command, let’s run <code>find .</code> (remember to run
this command from the <code>shell-lesson-data/exercise-data</code>
folder).</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ find .</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>.

./alkanes/pentane.pdb
./alkanes/methane.pdb
./alkanes/cubane.pdb</code></pre>
<p>As always, the <code>.</code> on its own means the current working
directory, which is where we want our search to start.
<code>find</code>’s output is the names of every file
<strong>and</strong> directory under the current working directory. This
can seem useless at first but <code>find</code> has many options to
filter the output and in this lesson we will discover some of them.</p>
<p>The first option in our list is <code>-type d</code> that means
‘things that are directories’. Sure enough, <code>find</code>’s output
is the names of the five directories (including <code>.</code>):</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ find . -type d</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>.
./writing
./creatures
./animal-counts
./alkanes</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the objects <code>find</code> finds are not listed in any
particular order. If we change <code>-type d</code> to
<code>-type f</code>, we get a listing of all the files instead:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ find . -type f</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>./writing/LittleWomen.txt
./writing/haiku.txt
./creatures/basilisk.dat
./creatures/unicorn.dat
./creatures/minotaur.dat
./animal-counts/animals.csv
./numbers.txt
./alkanes/ethane.pdb
./alkanes/propane.pdb
./alkanes/octane.pdb
./alkanes/pentane.pdb
./alkanes/methane.pdb
./alkanes/cubane.pdb</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s try matching by name:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ find . -name *.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>./numbers.txt</code></pre>
<p>We expected it to find all the text files, but it only prints out
<code>./numbers.txt</code>. The problem is that the shell expands
wildcard characters like <code>*</code> <em>before</em> commands run.
Since <code>*.txt</code> in the current directory expands to
<code>./numbers.txt</code>, the command we actually ran was:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ find . -name numbers.txt</code></pre>
<p><code>find</code> did what we asked; we just asked for the wrong
thing.</p>
<p>To get what we want, let’s do what we did with <code>grep</code>: put
<code>*.txt</code> in quotes to prevent the shell from expanding the
<code>*</code> wildcard. This way, <code>find</code> actually gets the
pattern <code>*.txt</code>, not the expanded filename
<code>numbers.txt</code>:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ find . -name &quot;*.txt&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>./writing/LittleWomen.txt
./writing/haiku.txt
./numbers.txt</code></pre>
<div id="listing-vs.-finding" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Listing vs. Finding</h2>
<p><code>ls</code> and <code>find</code> can be made to do similar
things given the right options, but under normal circumstances,
<code>ls</code> lists everything it can, while <code>find</code>
searches for things with certain properties and shows them.</p>
</div>
<p>As we said earlier, the command line’s power lies in combining tools.
We’ve seen how to do that with pipes; let’s look at another technique.
As we just saw, <code>find . -name "*.txt"</code> gives us a list of all
text files in or below the current directory. How can we combine that
with <code>wc -l</code> to count the lines in all those files?</p>
<p>The simplest way is to put the <code>find</code> command inside
<code>$()</code>:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ wc -l $(find . -name &quot;*.txt&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>  21022 ./writing/LittleWomen.txt
     11 ./writing/haiku.txt
      5 ./numbers.txt
  21038 total</code></pre>
<p>When the shell executes this command, the first thing it does is run
whatever is inside the <code>$()</code>. It then replaces the
<code>$()</code> expression with that command’s output. Since the output
of <code>find</code> is the three filenames
<code>./writing/LittleWomen.txt</code>,
<code>./writing/haiku.txt</code>, and <code>./numbers.txt</code>, the
shell constructs the command:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ wc -l ./writing/LittleWomen.txt ./writing/haiku.txt ./numbers.txt</code></pre>
<p>which is what we wanted. This expansion is exactly what the shell
does when it expands wildcards like <code>*</code> and <code>?</code>,
but lets us use any command we want as our own ‘wildcard’.</p>
<p>It’s very common to use <code>find</code> and <code>grep</code>
together. The first finds files that match a pattern; the second looks
for lines inside those files that match another pattern. Here, for
example, we can find txt files that contain the word “searching” by
looking for the string ‘searching’ in all the <code>.txt</code> files in
the current directory:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ grep &quot;searching&quot; $(find . -name &quot;*.txt&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>./writing/LittleWomen.txt:sitting on the top step, affected to be searching for her book, but was
./writing/haiku.txt:With searching comes loss</code></pre>
<div class="challenge">
<div id="matching-and-subtracting" class="section level2">
<h2>Matching and Subtracting</h2>
<p>The <code>-v</code> option to <code>grep</code> inverts pattern
matching, so that only lines which do <em>not</em> match the pattern are
printed. Given that, which of the following commands will find all .dat
files in <code>creatures</code> except <code>unicorn.dat</code>? Once
you have thought about your answer, you can test the commands in the
<code>shell-lesson-data/exercise-data</code> directory.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>None of the above.</li>

<div id="solution-38" class="section level2 solution">
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Option 1. is correct. Putting the match expression in quotes prevents
the shell expanding it, so it gets passed to the <code>find</code>
command.</p>
<p>Option 2 is also works in this instance because the shell tries to
expand <code>*.dat</code> but there are no <code>*.dat</code> files in
the current directory, so the wildcard expression gets passed to
<code>find</code>. We first encountered this in <a
href="03-create.md">episode 3</a>.</p>
<p>Option 3 is incorrect because it searches the contents of the files
for lines which do not match ‘unicorn’, rather than searching the file
names.</p>

<div id="binary-files" class="section level2 callout">
<h2>Binary Files</h2>
<p>We have focused exclusively on finding patterns in text files. What
if your data is stored as images, in databases, or in some other
format?</p>
<p>A handful of tools extend <code>grep</code> to handle a few non text
formats. But a more generalizable approach is to convert the data to
text, or extract the text-like elements from the data. On the one hand,
it makes simple things easy to do. On the other hand, complex things are
usually impossible. For example, it’s easy enough to write a program
that will extract X and Y dimensions from image files for
<code>grep</code> to play with, but how would you write something to
find values in a spreadsheet whose cells contained formulas?</p>
<p>A last option is to recognize that the shell and text processing have
their limits, and to use another programming language. When the time
comes to do this, don’t be too hard on the shell. Many modern
programming languages have borrowed a lot of ideas from it, and
imitation is also the sincerest form of praise.</p>
</div>
<p>The Unix shell is older than most of the people who use it. It has
survived so long because it is one of the most productive programming
environments ever created — maybe even <em>the</em> most productive. Its
syntax may be cryptic, but people who have mastered it can experiment
with different commands interactively, then use what they have learned
to automate their work. Graphical user interfaces may be easier to use
at first, but once learned, the productivity in the shell is unbeatable.
And as Alfred North Whitehead wrote in 1911, ‘Civilization advances by
extending the number of important operations which we can perform
without thinking about them.’</p>
